<h1>MING FUNG: &#8220;RECENT WORK&#8221;.</h1>
<p>sponsored by ARCHITECTURE +</p>
<p><strong>HsinMing Fung</strong>, AIA, is Principal and Director of Design for the internationally renowned architecture firm Hodgetts + Fung (H+F). With a lifelong commitment to the arts and education, she brings a sensibility distilled from her background as an émigré to a design practice energized by her search for meaning. Fluent in five languages, she additionally brings an acute sense of cultural relevance to the work of the studio, lending important perspectives to a profession which all too often is dominated by practical concerns. Having lived in several countries, Ming’s comprehension of the human experience in various urban environments adds a unique insight to her designs, facilitating accessibility without compromising intellectual integrity.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Since founding H+F in 1984 with partner Craig Hodgetts, FAIA, Ming has overseen the design of distinguished projects such as the renovated Hollywood Bowl, Menlo-Atherton Performing Arts Center, txhe Wild Beast Pavilion at California Institute of the Arts, and a host of other influential designs. Current projects include renovation of the historic Robert Frost Auditorium in Culver City, the Rosa Parks Metro station, a mixed-use development in West Hollywood, the Chapel of the North American Martyrs at Jesuit High School in Sacramento, and the Diamond Head Theatre in O’Ahu.</span></p>
<p>Following an eight-year relationship with the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) as Graduate Programs Director and Design Studio faculty, Ming was appointed to the new position of Director of Academic Affairs in the fall of 2010. Awarded an AIA Gold Medal Award in 2006, Ming also served as Presidential Appointee to the National Endowment for the Arts Council in 2001. In 1994, Craig and Ming were Honorees of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and Ming was a 1991 recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Rome Prize Advance Fellowship. Most recently Ming was appointed the 2013 President-Elect of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA), a non-profit, membership organization.</p>

<p>[Final Project Mid-Semester Review]</p>
<p>Midterm Reviews were concluded with a review of the work from Chris Perry and Ted Ngai&#8217;s thesis students. The work represents the halfway mark for students within their final year at the School of Architecture. Students and faculty came together to critique and review the work as their semester enters its final stretch.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The students working with Ted Ngai have applied the material and fabrication techniques they analyzed, studied and developed in their first semester in order to curate and generate large scale urban integration themes among the students final projects.</span></p>
<p>Chris Perry&#8217;s students similarly offer large scale integration into the existing urban fabrics of cities ranging from Buffalo, New York to Los Angeles California. Concerns of architectural restoration, revival, and adaptive reuse have posed interesting opportunities, questions, and concerns for these young designers.</p>
<p>Students have presented the defense of their thesis and final projects and will present the final product to colleagues, professors, and critiques at their final review in the coming weeks as the semester draws to a close in late April and early May.</p>

<h1>FALL 2014.</h1>
<h3>ARCH4020/CIVIL4020 Bedford Seminar: Advanced Building Structures (Civil)</h3>
<p>This interdisciplinary seminar consists of students from both the School of Architecture and Civil Engineering department. Presentation of a variety of structural typologies bears direct relation to practical experience and the necessity for constructive interdisciplinary discourse. Specific structural typologies are examined through historic and contemporary project examples that are critically deconstructed and critically analyzed with respect to their basic engineering principles and architectural concepts. Students will be exposed to the collaborative methods inherent within the architect/engineer relationship. The course consists of lectures concerning each topic, case studies and presentations of relevant projects, an interdisciplinary design project and discussion of the projects and presentations with respect to interdisciplinary discourse. Content and delivery may vary by instructor.  Michael Stein R 6-8:50 pm. Cr. 3. Taught with CIVL4020. Prerequisite: Arch2230 Structures 1.</p>
<h3>ARCH4170.80 Environmental Parametrics</h3>
<p>The work of this course sets out to describe the meaning, values, and methods of using parametric techniques as both an analytical tool and a generative device in comprehensive performance-based building design. The students learn techniques to set-up feedback between analysis and tactical response in performance-based design while also situating these techniques within the broader discourse and methodology of fostering design ecologies and creating ecologies of design as they relate to the construction of the built environment and contemporary issues of sustainability. Taught at CASE NYC.</p>
<h3>ARCH4750 Sustainable Building Design Metrics</h3>
<p>A review of current and anticipated metrics associated with sustainable building design will be reviewed as well as construction practices in the building industry will be discussed.  We will review how sustainable design practice can mitigate the climate change in a positive way. An understanding of energy terminology is useful for this course. Lectures, discussions, field trips and assigned reading will be utilized to explore the subject matter. Oliver Holmes. M 6 &#8211; 9 pm. Cr. 2</p>
<h3>ARCH4840 Architectural Acoustics 1</h3>
<p>Providing an overview of the essentials for architectural acoustics design of performance and public spaces, including concert halls, theaters, museums, classrooms, sports arenas, courtrooms, and religious buildings. The course may be used as a concentration in an architecture student’s professional electives, or the beginning of a master’s degree in acoustics. Covering basic principles of sound, room acoustics, sound absorption in rooms, sound isolation and privacy, acoustics of mechanical systems, and sound quality.  After Architecture Acoustics 1 &amp; 2, students should be prepared for a basic entry-level position in either acoustics in architecture, or in acoustical consulting.  Todd Brooks  F 10–11:50, F 12–1:50 pm. Cr 4. (can be used towards a minor in Acoustics).</p>

<h3> ARCH4961.01 Duchamp Seminar: Anarchism Umped</h3>
<p>Explore the life, work and influence of Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968), inventor of the readymade and father of conceptual art. By examining his ideas and those of his peers we will critically map his influence on 20th century art and architecture. Speculated as “the world’s first feminist artist” by curator Helen Molesworth, Duchamp continues to impact art discourse, 44 years after his death. Readings, response papers, field trips (to the Philadelphia Museum of Art) and discussions with two of the world’s leading Duchamp authorities, Francis Naumann and Michael Taylor. Michael Oatman. W 10–11:50 am. Cr 2.</p>
<h3>ARCH4964.01 Sensory Culture</h3>
<p>This seminar examines human perception from a designer’s perspective. It draws on perspectives from the sciences, arts, and humanities in order to build an understanding of how we perceive and interact with the environments we create. One can not only read about perception, the seminar will augment reading with a range of direct experiences as source material for discussion.  Ted Krueger. W. 10-12. Cr. 2</p>
<h3>ARCH4967 Robotic Material Assemblies</h3>
<p>This course is an advanced design seminar that explores the use of robotic gantry for direct material assembly. The primary objective is to understand all the different processes involved in the emerging 3D/4D printing technologies, from modifying the material properties to writing motion control code that directs the assembly process. The first component of the course will be to teach students how to write custom g-code to control a 3-axis motion gantry, pneumatic injector, and temperature controller. This part will require students to have prior knowledge of Rhino 3D and Rhino Grasshopper. The second component will be to learn to modify the material properties. Ted Ngai. W 12-2. Cr.2</p>
<h3>ARCH4968 Architectural Ceramics.</h3>
<p>The path that goes from clay to ceramics traces the history of masonry. Similarly, in the path from the unit to the multiple, a significant part of the history of building has been written . This hands-on workshop will merge low and high tech approaches to develop critical and innovative investigations of ceramics techniques and their processes (forming, drying, firing). The material focus will be on slip casting methods as a way to speculate about the possibilities of “vessel space” &#8212; the negative body shaped by the mold and the continuous surface of the slip material – searching for an epistemological inversion in the way that architectural form is thought and designed. The final project will consist in the design and development of three-dimensional units that challenge the idea of what a “brick” could be. Basic knowledge on digital fabrication desired but not required. Gustavo Crembil. Tue 1-3. Cr. 3</p>

<h3>ARCH6310.80 Environmental History &amp; Theory</h3>
<p>This course has been conceived in tandem with the Integrative Materials Course and with Built Ecologies Design Research Studio, such that each student will develop a complementary written analysis that critically situates the new material system that the student is developing in design studio within historical, socio-political and economic flows. The written analysis will directly reference key themes contained within the required readings, lectures, and seminar discussions. Anna Dyson. Cr 3. (Taught at CASE in NYC).</p>
<h3>ARCH6340.80 Material Systems and Productions</h3>
<p>This seminar will investigate emerging functional materials addressing physical adaptability to environmental and climatic fluctuations. Bio-climatic responsiveness via multi-scale intelligence will be examined from innovations on material simulation systems, low energy/low waste manufacturing, raw material reduction and material reduction and material consumption reduction within potential design applications. Design exercises will develop building systems or products that reduce material use, weight, volume or energy consumption with the goal of increasing the environmental performance of the system. Jason Vollen.  Cr 3. (Taught at CASE in NYC w/4960)</p>
<h3>ARCH6370.80 Environmental Parametrics Workshop MAII</h3>
<p>This course is an intensive workshop that exposes the students at the Center for Architectural Science and Ecology to the computational platforms and parametric techniques that will be used in the analysis and visualization of building and urban scale bioclimactic flows in addition to the whole-building energy matrix. Furthermore, the course uses project-based exercises to expose the broad issues of ecological thinking in built ecologies such as multiple variable trade-off optimization of systems and morphological and tectonic optimization. This course meets in the Fall and is offered to M.Arch 2 students attending the Center for Architectural Science + Ecology (CASE) Post-Professional (M.Arch2) Environmental Parametrics Program.  2 Credits</p>
<h3>ARCH6380.80 Graduate Environmental Parametrics M.Arch 1</h3>
<p>The work of this course sets out to describe the meaning, values, and methods of using parametric techniques as both an analytical tool and a generative device in comprehensive performance-based building design.  The students learn techniques to set-up feedback between analysis and tactical response in performance-based design while also situating these techniques within the broader discourse and methodology of fostering design ecologies and creating ecologies of design as they relate to the construction of the built environment and contemporary issues of sustainability.
