<p>At the Newfound Middle School, we culminated a month long reading of Murray&#8217;s A Writer Teaches Writing by using the 4 &#8211; A&#8217;s protocol to share our thinking. It was amazing to hear from teachers across disciplines about new strategies they will be sharing with students. We also dispelled some myths about what students can do in terms of their own writing. Our gym teacher also shared writing he had done with students around what it would be like to be a specific piece of athletic equipment. Awesome!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Literature of Place will explore how to use writing and literature to examine the history, culture and ecology of the place in which we live. Literature selections include <em>Amos Fortune: Free Man, Our Town, </em>and <em>Our Nig</em>, all with significance to the Monadnock Region. This institute will introduce the many different aspects of place-based writing. Prior participants in “Writing our Communities” institutes are welcome, but no prior participation is required. Participants will develop instructional units appropriate to their teaching or work situations, explore the use of artifacts in their lives and in our history and culture, and examine how these reflect relationships of power.</p>
<p>This institute is appropriate for educators in all disciplines at all grade levels as well as community members involved in working with children or schools.  Through readings, demonstrations, and activities, participants will learn strategies and activities to implement place-based learning into their particular classes.</p>
<p>The cost of the institute is $350; districts sending 6 or more participants can pay $300 per person. Three graduate credits from Plymouth State University are available at the reduced rate of  $165 per credit and a $25 registration fee.</p>
<p>Instructors and facilitators for this series are Peterborough native Meg Petersen, Director of the National Writing Project in New Hampshire, and local retired educator Jill Lawler, a teacher consultant with NWPNH.  For more information contact Meg Petersen at <a href="mailto:megjoanna@gmail.com">megjoanna@gmail.com</a>. To register return the bottom to the address printed below. We look forward to working with you.  Registration form available<a href="https://www.plymouth.edu/outreach/nwpnh/files/2011/02/Literature-of-Place-3.pdf"> here</a>.</p>
