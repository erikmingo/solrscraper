                    <p>Emeritus Trustee Richard P. &#8220;Dick&#8221; Wollenberg died at his home in Longview, Washington on July 2, 2014. He was 98.</p>
                                <p>&#8220;The Reed College community lost a great friend and benefactor,&#8221; says President John Kroger. &#8220;Through his generosity and leadership, he helped build the College into what it is today.&#8221;</p>
                                <p>Wollenberg served four decades on the Reed College board of trustees (1962&#8211;2005), inlcuding nine years as board chairman (1982&#8211;91).</p>
                                <p>He also chaired the board&#8217;s budget policy committee from its inception in 1992 until 2004. Projects launched with his support include the establishment of the president&#8217;s discretionary fund, the endowment of a professorship in economics in honor of professor George A. Hay [economics 1956&#8211;83], and the completion of several major science facilities projects.</p>
                                <p>Wollenberg&#8217;s influence ran deeper than any particular project, however. When he joined the board in 1962 the endowment was almost nonexistent. By 1972, it had reached $3 million, and by the time he left the board in 2005, the endowment was valued at $350 million. Today it is $538 million.</p>

                                <p class="normal">Always ready for a grand appearance, the <b>Meat Smoke Crew</b> greeted guests with enough pulled pork and brisket sandwiches to choke a Doyle Owl. Gigantic Brewing offered samples of its latest seasonal beers, including the Firebird smoked Hefeweizen, which founder <b>Van Havig &#8217;92</b> described as &#8220;like a peanut butter cup . . . two great things making one amazing thing.&#8221; Next door, <b>Daniel Thomas &#8217;89</b> served up delicious red and green tamales from his popular Portland restaurant Xico.</p>
                                <p class="normal">One of the most arresting displays belonged to <b>Bob Combs &#8217;90 </b>of Combs Honey, whose table featured a transparent container filled with honeycomb&#8212;and live bees.

                    <p>Prof. <strong>Kyle Ormsby</strong> [mathematics 2014&#8211;], who is set to start his tenure-track position at Reed this fall, is already bringing in the accolades. In May, Reed received a $172,146 research grant from the National Science Foundation for a project under Ormsby&#8217;s direction. The project &#8220;Structure and computations in motivic and chromatic homotopy&#8221; begins in September and continues through August 2017.</p>
                                <p>If the title leaves you scratching your head, Ormsby explains that the grant will provide support for his study of "some pieces of mathematics that lie at the intersection of topology and algebraic geometry.&#8221; Algebraic geometry, as you undoubtedly know, &#8220;narrows the focus of geometry, only studying shapes that are defined by polynomial equations.&#8221; Topology is the study of geometric properties that are unchanged by the continuous deformation of figures. For example, topologists consider doughnuts and coffee cups to belong to the same class (single-holed objects) because one could be stretched to resemble another.</p>
                                <p>&#8220;If topology&#8217;s objects are made out of saltwater taffy,&#8221; says Ormsby, &#8220;then algebraic geometry&#8217;s objects are constructed from peanut brittle&#8212;far more rigid and inflexible.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>From time to time, alumni ask me what the Annual Fund actually supports. My answer: <em>basically everything</em>.</p>
                                <p>In the last year, for example, the Annual Fund helped Reed:</p>
                                <p>&#8226; welcome 356 new students to campus<br/>&#8226; open a new Performing Arts Building<br/>&#8226; hire 9 new professors from Harvard, Oxford, Yale, Cornell, and Stanford, among others<br/>&#8226; license 22 students as nuclear reactor operators<br/>&#8226; crown 321 scholars with thesis laurels</p>
                                <p>The Annual Fund&#8217;s <em>dollar</em> goal is an ambitious $4,084,000, a whopping number that is hard to wrap your head around. Just as important, however, is the goal for <em>participation</em>: 4,400 donors, out of a total pool of roughly 15,000 living alumni.</p>

                                <p>A member of the Alumni Fundraising for Reed Committee, Allen has been exploring data on alumni giving for the past year. Presenting his findings at a Reunons 2014:Reedfayre Paideia class, &#8220;How Reedies Give: An Unapologetically Nerdy Exploration,&#8221; Allen showed the audience a new way of looking at (or looking <i>for</i>) alumni who give back to Reed.</p>
                                <p>The first lesson Allen&#8217;s exploration revealed is that <em>consistency is king.</em> Over the last five years, some 1,550 alumni made a gift to Reed every year. Contributions from that group account for a whopping $20 million&#8212;the lion&#8217;s share of the total amount given to the Annual Fund in that time.</p>

                    <p>Reed alumni spanning five decades descended on Cerf amphitheatre last week for Fanfayre Friday, the start of weekend festivities for <a href="http://reedfayre.reed.edu/" target="_blank">Reunions '14: Reedfayre</a>, June 4-8. The mood was festive (possibly more than usual because the signature cocktail known as Plato&#8217;s Punch swirled among the celebrants). <b>Greg Byshenk &#8217;89</b><strong>,</strong> president of the alumni board of directors, took the microphone and bid people find their seats. From the start, he set the theme of Fanfayre as one of gratitude, thanking the volunteers and class leaders who had come together to organize Reunions.</p>
                                <p>Comedian <b>Yoram Bauman &#8217;95</b> was introduced as "the world&#8217;s first stand-up economist" and the author of the newly published <i>The Cartoon Introduction to Climate Change</i>. Bauman launched into a polished comedy routine where he divided the crowd into various parts of the political spectrum and proceeded to rib the right and the left in turn. He poked at the Tea Party as people who &#8220;believe in social darwinism but don&#8217;t believe in Darwin,&#8221; but refused to make fun of the Occupy movement because &#8220;you are not allowed to make fun of the dead.&#8221;</p>
                                <p>The Babson Society Outstanding Volunteer Award was presented to Reed's own Meat Smoke Crew, the alumni group that has been hosting Renn Fayre feasts since 1985. Accepting the award on behalf of the crew, <b>Andy McLain &#8217;92</b> extoled the value of alumni-student interaction. Meat Smoke, he said, offered students the &#8220;comfort of a warm fire and the likelihood of a warm morsel.&#8221; Based on his experience, he reassured alumni that Reed students have not changed. &#8220;The kids are alright, I promise,&#8221; he said.</p>

                    <p>Pythagoras proposed the harmony of the spheres; <b>Anya Demko &#8217;14 </b>and <b>Allie Morgan &#8217;14</b> built the harmony of the stairs.</p>
                                <p>In April, the two physics majors installed a series of lasers and phototransistors on the spiral staircase in Vollum, turning the steps into a giant, twisting keyboard spanning two octaves on a C major scale.</p>
                                <p>To play the keyboard, you jump from one tread to another. Each time your foot lands on a tread, it interrupts a laser beam, triggering a musical tone. Stepping nimbly down the staircase generates the synthetic jig of an ice cream truck. Charging back up sets off an avalanche of organ tones that sound like JS Bach clearing his throat.</p>
                                <p>The two seniors spent many hours designing the circuitry, constructing the hardware, and installing the lasers in Vollum. &#8220;It was really a great experience,&#8221; says Anya. &#8220;This was the first time we really got to design our own circuits.&#8221;</p>

                    <p>Political prankster Igor Vamos &#8217;90, member of the media-jamming duo the <a href="http://theyesmen.org/">Yes Men</a>, ran true to form Monday at commencement ceremonies at Reed.</p>
                                <p>Vamos, who plays the character Mike Bonanno in&#160;the&#160;Yes Men, is known for sophisticated political satire, in which he often impersonates industry or government officials and concocts mock websites.</p>
                                <p>His latest prank was directed squarely at his own alma mater, however. In the middle of his commencement address, Vamos announced that he had learned over breakfast that the college was about to divest its $500 million endowment from fossil fuels.</p>

                                    <p><img alt="Reed College " src="assets/images/pete_rock_scarf.jpg" width="277"/></p>
                                
                    <p>Peter Rock, professor of creative writing, has won a Guggenheim Fellowship to support work on his latest project, <em>Spells</em>. Known for the creative freedom they facilitate, Guggenheim awards are granted upon the basis of impressive achievement and exceptional promise for future accomplishment.</p>
                                <p><em>Spells</em> is a fragmentary novel done in collaboration with five photographers. The idea came to Prof. Rock years ago while he was working as a security guard in an art museum. To pass the time, he would invent stories inspired by the artwork he was guarding. Examples of this project are found on his <a href="http://peterrockproject.com/spells" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
                                <p>Rock, who has taught creative writing in the English department at Reed since 2001, is the author of six novels, most recently <em>The Shelter Cycle </em>and<em> My Abandonment</em>, and a collection of stories, <em>The Unsettling</em>. His books have been translated into several languages, and his stories have appeared in magazines such as <em>Zoetrope: All-Story, Tin House, Epoch, </em>and<em> Ploughshares</em>; they have been anthologized widely. He attended Deep Springs College, received a BA in English from Yale University, and held a Wallace Stegner Fellowship at Stanford University.&#160;</p>
