	<p><a href=""></a>Over the past two years, Syracuse University Libraries have been planning for a renovation of the Learning Commons in Bird Library, which has not had a furnishings upgrade since its opening in 1972. A planning group visited with furniture vendors, interviewed students, toured other universities and colleges, and absorbed leading edge research about working habits in contemporary education and of millennial students.</p>
<p>Libraries’ leaders have also met with donors about this project. In particular, SU parents Mark and Christine Turner, who have chosen to honor their children by providing a significant gift in support of these new furnishings.</p>
<p>Chancellor Syverud recently announced a project to upgrade the layout and furnishings of the first floor of Bird Library, to be completed by the beginning of the fall 2014 semester.</p>
<p>The new furnishings will give the first floor more than a face lift. With power outlets built into the furniture and more networking added to the floor, students will no longer feel compelled to rearrange the furniture. The new environment will have a clean, modern look and be conducive to various types of collaboration and individual study.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the summer, Circulation, Technology, and Research Assistance services will be available from the center corridor of the first floor. The East side of the floor will remain open for use until July 30, however there will be no user seating or public PCs on the first floor from August 1 until Monday, August 25.</p>
<p>To accommodate the reduction in public space in Bird Library, the Carnegie Library Reading Room and the computer cluster in room 208 will reopen on or around August 1.</p>]]></content>

	<p><a href=""></a>Lucy Mulroney has been appointed Interim Senior Director of the Special Collections Research Center at the Syracuse University Libraries, where she has served as Curator since 2011. The position was held previously by Sean Quimby, who resigned to become Director of the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University. The appointment will take effect on September 1, 2014.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am delighted that Lucy Mulroney has accepted this position,&#8221; said Interim Dean of Libraries and University Librarian K. Matthew Dames. &#8220;Her professional experience and academic credentials give her the ideal background to carry the division forward during this interim period and to continue our efforts in making the Libraries&#8217; exceptional special collections more broadly accessible to students and scholars.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mulroney received a Ph.D. in Visual and Cultural Studies in 2013 from the University of Rochester. Her dissertation, “Andy Warhol, Publisher,” won the Outstanding Dissertation Award in the Humanities and Humanistic Social Sciences and the Henry Luce Dissertation Award in American Art at the University of Rochester. She also holds a B.A. in Art History, Theory, and Criticism from the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p>At the Syracuse University Libraries, she was co-organizer of the recently-created <i>Critical Connections</i> lecture series (with Mr. Quimby) and the <i>Positions of Dissent</i> Ray Smith Symposium with the College of Arts and Sciences in 2012-13. Dr. Mulroney also has played an active role in the Libraries’ exhibitions program, most recently curating <i>The Archive in Motion</i> exhibit, and co-curating the 2013 <i>Strange Victories: Grove Press 1951–1985</i> exhibit at Bird Library and the Palitz Gallery at Lubin House.</p>
<p>Dr. Mulroney, an active scholar, has published a number of journal articles, book chapters, and critical reviews. Her article “Editing Andy Warhol” appeared in <i>Grey Room</i> 46 (MIT Press, 2012). She is a frequent lecturer and presenter, locally, nationally, and internationally. She most recently presented “Publishing in (and as) Practice” at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 2014.</p>
<p>Dr. Mulroney is a member of the College Art Association, the Art Libraries Society of Western New York, and the Upstate New York Print Culture Consortium.</p>]]></content>
