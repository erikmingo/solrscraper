		<content type="html" xml:base="https://faculty.franklin.edu/michael-posey/2011/02/25/winter-boost/"><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, January through mid-March is the toughest for college students.  It doesn&#8217;t matter what your age or circumstance, there is just something about this time of year that gives us the blahs!  With bad weather, dark skies, etc&#8230;it&#8217;s  easy to get depressed or bummed and take our eye off of our studies or courses.  It&#8217;s the time of year one just wants to huddle-in at home.</p>
<p>I would say that this time of year is a GREAT time to focus on your studies and work.  Look at it this way&#8230;there is nothing you can really do outside (unless you are really into winter sports)&#8230;the days are dreary and waking up each morning brings a new batch of weather to contend with.  What better time to devote to your college career.  What better time to go that extra mile with your work than when it is crappy outside and you can&#8217;t do anything else.  So don&#8217;t let this time of year get you down or take your eye off the ball&#8230;use it to focus on your college work and then you&#8217;ll have more time on your hands when the weather does get nice outside!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="https://faculty.franklin.edu/michael-posey/2010/12/01/the-end-of-the-term-the-end-of-the-year/"><![CDATA[<p>The end of the term is upon us.  The leaves have fallen, the wind is cold, and the sky has turned gray.  The end of Fall Term not only signals the change of seasons but it is also the end of another year and in a sense a change in every one of us.   2010 was definitely an interesting year.  In reality, it was a year much like every year.  It was filled with ups and downs on a world, local, professional, and personal level.  Simply put, it was another year of learning.   We learn in so many different ways throughout the year.  We learn at home, at work, at school, and simply by going through life.</p>
<p>The old adage of  &#8220;Live and Learn&#8221; is one that stands the test of time.  As this year comes to a close, I encourage everyone to reflect on what they have learned this year.  The challenge is to not only reflect and learn from one&#8217;s &#8220;book learning&#8221; (we do that every day in a college environment), but to learn from one&#8217;s life.  That&#8217;s the more difficult learning&#8230;the learning that takes concerted effort.   Take this year&#8217;s lessons, inside of the classroom AND outside the classroom, and embrace them&#8230;the good and the bad.   Most of all, resolve to learn from every experience that you have, handle those experiences with dignity, and use what you&#8217;ve learned to move forward.  By doing so you will ultimately learn more than you can ever learn from any one book.</p>
