		<content type="html" xml:base="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/?p=754"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The University Art Gallery will open the 2014-2015 exhibition season with David Southwood: N1 and Beach Boys, an exhibition that brings together two connected bodies of work by the internationally recognized South African artist: The N1 (National Road One) project, and Beach Boys. Both projects combine photography with social commitment, and both explore transitional, marginal places and the question of what it takes to make a “place.” Southwood will speak about his work on September 5th at 4:30 in Convocation Hall, with a brief introduction by art historian and photographer Meghan Kirkwood of North Dakota State University. Please join us for the talk and reception!</p>
<p><a href="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/uag-southwood-exhibit-card-web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-755" src="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/uag-southwood-exhibit-card-web.jpg" alt="uag southwood exhibit card web" width="621" height="441" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The N1 series profiles the longest freeway in South Africa, the road that connects country’s two largest cities, Cape Town and Johannesburg. It depicts, in Southwood’s words, “the highway as an awkward place, the stage for un-choreographed events, the migrating protagonists of which were never intended to use the highway.” Beach Boys also asks questions about place and its inhabitants. The series documents the lives of a group of Tanzanian stowaways who live amongst the N1 infrastructure in Cape Town. Responsibility for this group of men, living without passports or travel documentation, is not claimed by South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs, nor by shipping agents, nor by the government of Tanzania. The group resists the help of NGOs. The place they inhabit is similarly interstitial, in the words of Nic Coetzer this ‘place’ “is an accident, the consequence of other intentions.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="David Southwood Photography" href="http://davesouthwood.com/" target="_blank">David Southwood</a> combines photography, social commitment, and a deep interest in urban landscapes. In 2000, together with some township photographers, he set up the first non-profit organization for ‘street photographers’ in the Western Cape. The organization, Umlilo (ilisolabantu.org), remains active today. In 2004, Southwood was awarded the International Bauhaus Award for his collaborative project (with Matthew Barac and Simone le Fevre) on the theme of the contemporary city’s “transit spaces,” and in 2008 he co-curated and participated in the exhibition “Cities in Crisis” at the University of Johannesburg’s FADA Gallery. Southwood has a diverse and accomplished exhibition record. Among other venues, he has shown at the South African National Gallery, the Venice Biennale of Architecture, and the Goethe Institute in Johannesburg. Southwood lives with his dog, Cressida, in Cape Town.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sewanee’s University Art Gallery is located on Georgia Avenue on the campus of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee.  The gallery is free, accessible, and open to the public. Hours are 10 – 5 Tuesday through Friday and 12 – 4 on Saturday and Sunday.  Please call (931) 598-1223 for more information.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/?p=716"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The University Art Gallery will close the 2013 – 2014 exhibition season with S<em>enior Art Majors: Transparency and Impressions</em>, on view from April 11 through May 10, 2014. Please join us in the University Art Gallery on April 11 at 4:30 for brief introductory remarks and a reception. The artists will give formal talks about their work on April 12 in Convocation Hall, between 1:30 and 4:30. On May 10th, the University Art Gallery will close the season and celebrate the Senior Art Majors with a Baccalaureate reception, from 1 to 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Senior-Art-Postcard-2014web.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-733 alignleft" alt="Senior Art Postcard 2014web" src="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Senior-Art-Postcard-2014web.jpg" width="605" height="430" /></a>Transparency and Impressions</em> explores the quality of transparency, and what it means to make or receive an impression. Many of the senior art majors use transparent materials in their work, like plastic, glass, or light projections. Some depict transparent forms such as ghostly figures, unfurling smoke, or still water. Transparency for these artists also refers to honesty, whether about one’s past experiences, personal meditations, or background. While something transparent might seem easily accessible, lending itself to a quick first impression, sometimes a closer look is necessary, and a second impression vital.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tess Erlenborn’s fairytale-inspired paper installations and drawings of imagined creatures represent the overcoming of personal fears. Courtney Moseley’s photographs, paper collages, and quilted works expose her own vulnerabilities related to home and family. In his drawings and paintings, Curtis Johnson confronts his own identity by dissecting the stereotypes and social issues associated with his racial and cultural heritage. Caleb Schaubroeck uses semi-raw and unfinished materials like wood and electrical wires to evoke origins, guilt, and personal freedom. Cole York’s black and white photography explores relationships between people of different cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds, as they move through their first and second impressions of one another. John Adams’ drawings, 3D prints, and animations put color, geometry, and forms of infinitely increasing structural complexity to transcendent effect. Channing Title-Fiske’s digitally manipulated, abstract photographs of circular forms examine the power of light. Emmy Faison’s paintings, drawings, etchings, and sculptural installations use transparency to explore time, dissolution, and self-preservation. Caroline Minchew’s large-format photographs of lakes and vernal pools convey stillness, peacefulness, and otherness through layering and light. Andrew Lyman, in his oil paintings, repeats the image of an enigmatic, ghostly king in vast atmospheres to evoke the struggle against becoming insignificant in death. Through video and installation, Jesse Bruen explores the ability of film to distort time and motion, and to reveal irrational habits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sewanee’s University Art Gallery is located on Georgia Avenue on the campus of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. The gallery is free, accessible, and open to the public. Hours are 10 – 5 Tuesday through Friday and 12 – 4 on Saturday and Sunday. Please call (931) 598-1223 for more information.</p>

Records of first-time encounters, taken at night in isolated locations, lit by moonlight and a single handheld flashlight, these photographs construct fragile, intimate relationships between artist, subject, and viewer. Nakadate will speak about her work on April 4th at 4:30 pm in Convocation Hall. Reception to follow. In association with the exhibition, the Friends of the University Art Gallery will present a screening of the feature length film <em>The Wolf Knife</em> (2010), written and directed by Nakadate, on February 25th at 7:30 pm in the SUT.</p>
<p><a href="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LN_Relations_CarolinaBeach1_MG_2474_WEB.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-678 aligncenter" title="Laurel Nakadate, Carolina Beach, North Carolina #1, 2013, Type-C print, 40 x 60 inches " alt="Laurel Nakadate Carolina Beach, North Carolina #1, 2013 Type-C print 40 x 60 inches " src="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LN_Relations_CarolinaBeach1_MG_2474_WEB.jpg" width="576" height="384" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the summer of 2011, Laurel Nakadate began to photograph strangers for the <em>Star Portraits</em> series, inviting friends of friends, Facebook “friends,” and curious members of the online community to meet her at night in remote corners of the United States and Europe. During the same time period, Nakadate also undertook DNA and genealogical research, discovering genetic ties to the descendants of slaves and pilgrims, the McCoy clan, and the early Protestant feminist Anne Hutchinson, among others. She contacted distant relatives on DNA websites, and arranged to meet them, also at night, in order to make their portraits for <em>Relations</em>. Her subjects, whether distant relatives or Internet contacts, appeared for their portraits without prior instructions and chose their own clothing. The results are photographic performances that record the instant that the artist and her subjects see each other for the first time, capturing the connection of strangers. This connection has been an important part of Nakadate’s work since her earliest video pieces, in which she recorded herself dancing or singing with strangers met through chance encounters. In the photographs of <em>Strangers and Relations</em>, Nakadate does not appear in front of the camera herself, except in the DNA that she shares with her diverse subjects. She writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In my early videos, I physically appeared in the work.  In these new portraits, I am allowing my body, my DNA, to navigate my direction; where I will travel and whom I will meet. These strangers, who are also distant cousins, share bits of DNA with me – in some ways, these images become modern day self-portraits. I see these strangers, who are also relatives, as little glimmers of the ancestors who connected us hundreds of years ago.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-677"></span>Laurel Nakadate was born in Austin, Texas in 1975 and raised in Ames, Iowa. From 1999 to 2001, while completing her MFA in photography at Yale University, she began to create provocative works in video, photography, performance and film that challenge conventional perceptions of power, seduction, tenderness and trust. Nakadate’s early relationship to the fixed single viewpoint of the camera (as both artist and subject), her insistence on simple production values, and her upending of public and private ritualistic behaviors, anticipated the amateur video aesthetic of YouTube diaries and internet blogs. A major monograph, <em>365 Days: A Catalogue of Tears</em>, featuring a year long photographic “performance,” in which the artist forced herself to cry each day during the year 2010, was recently published by Hatje Cantz and the Zabludowicz Collection, London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laurel Nakadate has participated in solo and group exhibitions at museums and galleries worldwide including a critically acclaimed ten-year survey <em>Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely</em> at MoMA PS 1 in 2011. Her works are in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Cincinnati Art Museum; the Yale University Art Gallery; the Princeton University Art Museum; the Hessel Museum of Art at Bard College; the Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw; and other distinguished institutions. The artist has also received widespread acclaim for two feature-length films, <em>Stay the Same Never Change</em>, which premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, and <em>The Wolf Knife</em> (2010), which was nominated for Gotham and Independent Spirit Awards and was the featured work in The Believer Magazine’s 2012 annual film issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sewanee’s University Art Gallery is located on Georgia Avenue on the campus of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee.  The gallery is free, accessible, and open to the public. Hours are 10 – 5 Tuesday through Friday and 12 – 4 on Saturday and Sunday.  Please call (931) 598-1223 for more information.

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/?p=668"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The University Art Gallery presents <em>Lain York: Selections from the National Gallery</em>, on view from October 25 to December 15, 2013. Silhouettes derived from 18th and 19th century caricatures populate abstract fields of shiny, colored vinyl, inviting the viewer to imagine unfolding stories. Correction tape slices across wooden panels, evoking muddled paths and archeological digs. These playful, largely abstract images explore formal concerns, but also point to the subjective, constructed nature of historical record, and to the way the past echoes in the present. York will present his work in conversation with Dr. Jeff Thompson on November 15th at 4:30 in Convocation Hall. A reception will follow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/York-Selections-Card.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" style="border: 10px solid white;" alt="York-Selections-Card" src="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/York-Selections-Card.gif" width="576" height="409" /></a></p>
<p>Inspired in part by resonances between the 2012 American presidential election campaigns and his reading about the first four American presidencies, in this exhibition York explores the idea of “a visual archive of collected images,” or “an information stream.” The silhouettes, extracted from their historical contexts, surface in these compositions as if from a collective memory, and are offered to the viewer for reinterpretation. Echoes from the past appear in the present. How we understand the past shifts according to present needs.</p>
<p>Constructed from ephemeral, “charmingly cheesy” materials, like correction tape and stick-on vinyl, these works also play with medium, materials, and mark making. As York says, in a 2012 interview published in Nashville Arts Magazine, “What makes a painting a painting if you take away the paint?” York’s accessible, everyday materials encourage an informal, experimental approach, aligned with contemporary ‘provisional painting.’ Layered or excavated, foregrounding the time spent in their construction, the formal qualities of the paintings contribute meaningfully to the evocation of a subjective approach to history, and work counter to the formal tradition of academic history painting.</p>
<p>Lain York has been called the “Mayor of Art Town” for his essential role in the Nashville art scene. An accomplished painter, he is also the gallery director at the Zeitgeist Gallery. His work is represented in the collections of The Savannah College of Art and Design, the Tennessee State Museum, The Metropolitan Nashville Arts Commission, Trans-Financial Bank, Nashville, TN, EMI, Los Angeles, CA, as well as many private collections. In January 2014, he will open a solo show in the Contemporary Artist Project space at The Frist Center for the Visual Arts, Nashville. For more information about the artist, please visit http://lainyork.com.</p>

Malde’s beautiful color photographs are grouped in long strips applied directly to the Gallery walls, fostering a complex, immersive, and empathetic experience for the viewer. In Malde’s words, “the problem of Haiti matters to all of us.”</p>
<p>As part of The Sewanee Arts Festival, Sept. 11-21, The University Art Gallery will host two events in association with The Third Heaven. On Friday, Sept. 13, Malde will present the exhibition in an artist’s talk at 4:30 in Convocation Hall, next to the UAG, followed by a light reception. On Saturday, September 21, in conjunction with a campus wide, after hours Gallery Walk, the UAG will host a Haitian-inspired food tasting catered by Ivywild, from 4:30 to 7:30 pm.</p>
<p>Roadside trees, sleepers, the open spaces of abandoned buildings, rain, all appear in in The Third Heaven. These photographs, observations of fragments of experience, are meditative in tone. Avoiding the drama, and trauma, that are all too easily associated with Haiti, with these photographs Malde seeks the “quieter attitudes” he has experienced during his many trips to the country, and to “point to kindness, resilience, tenacity, and resourcefulness,” in face of the country’s lack of infrastructure and effective government. More information about this body of work can be found at <a title="http://pradipmalde.com/thethirdheaven" href="http://pradipmalde.com/thethirdheaven">http://pradipmalde.com/thethirdheaven</a>.</p>
<p>Pradip Malde is a professor of art at the University of the South. He teaches classes in photography, documentary photography and electronic media. Since graduating from the Glasgow School of Art in 1980, he has lived and worked as a photographic artist and teacher in Scotland and Tennessee. Malde has exhibited in Europe and the USA, and has works in numerous collections including the Princeton University Museum, Princeton, NJ, The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. He first traveled to Haiti in 2006, with S. Dixon Myers, Coordinator of Outreach Ministries at the University of the South. He has returned at least once a year since then, and works with students from the Episcopal University of Haiti in Port Au Prince and The Centre du Formacion Fritz Lafontant in Corporan, Haiti, on a the use of photography as a tool for community development (known as the Viewfinder Project).</p>

<p><a href="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Seniors-2013-Inv-Front-web.jpg"><img class="wp-image-603 aligncenter" style="border: 10px solid brown;" title="Seniors 2013 Inv Front web" src="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Seniors-2013-Inv-Front-web.jpg" alt="" width="609" height="441" /></a></p>
<p>“To intrigue” implies attraction or arousal—the wakening of curiosity or fascination—in addition to plotting, scheming, deceit, and even artifice. It implies an appeal to what interests people; it implies creation, though highly designed and manipulative. Still, intrigue maintains an elusive quality. This word proves, in many ways, applicable to the activity of the artist. An intrigue, a plot, a design, an artifice—is this the artist’s objective? Is it the art object itself? Works selected for this exhibition participate in the multiplicity of implications carried by the word intrigue. We, the artists, led by curiosity, pose questions about human existence, and begin to construct potential answers. In many cases, both the questions and answers remain elusive.</p>
<p><span id="more-602"></span>In the works presented as a part of this exhibition, the Sewanee Art Majors of 2013 investigate many different aspects of the human experience. Several of the artists explore what it means to live in human society. Frank Hand’s drawings illustrate the social dynamics of sameness and distinctiveness as figures variously fade into and emerge from an intricate fabric, texture, or network of other individuals. Sarah Peacock explores, through photography, what it is to inhabit particular social circles and their corresponding environments. Meg O’Neill’s photography explores the tension between self-imposed isolation and the construction of barriers, and the simultaneous invitation of attention and appeal for emotional connection.</p>
<p>Works by several of the artists are concerned with the human body. Virginia McCall’s garments treat body as a façade that might either assume or violate socially created gender expectations. Kathleen Catherall’s drawings, paintings, sculptures, and videos call attention to the way in which the body is manipulated, brought under the control of outside forces, and subjected to automatically triggered responses.</p>
<p>Others examine the human from philosophical perspectives. Emily Duncan’s drawings and photographs explore existential questions as they relate to the interaction between personal experience, memory, and time. Sarah Grace Pendergrass’ painted surfaces consider epistemological questions as derived from an understanding of the human body that relies on multiple (and contradictory) models.</p>
<p>Even those works that do not deal directly with human subject matter contemplate the objects that attract human fascination—objects cared for, preserved, loved, and played with by people. Cara Martin, through the craft of crochet, performs simultaneously protective and suffocating gestures upon collected natural objects and forms. Sally Mills, driven by her own fascination with paint and the painted surface, renders the shiny and alluring surfaces of beloved childhood toys. All of these works participate—through drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, and video—in an activity in which humans become both the subject and object of intrigue.</p>
<p>Sewanee’s University Art Gallery is located on Georgia Avenue on the campus of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee.  The gallery is free, accessible, and open to the public. Hours are 10 – 5 Tuesday through Friday and 12 – 4 on Saturday and Sunday.  Please call (931) 598-1223 for more information.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/?p=582"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The University Art Gallery, in coordination with the Carlos Gallery of the Nabit Art Building and the Jessie Ball duPont Library, presents <em>David Henderson: A Brief History of Aviation</em> in duPont Library and the Carlos Gallery, and <em>Brandon Morse: Dark Matter</em>, in the UAG. The opening of all three exhibitions will be celebrated with a panel discussion between the artists and Dr. Jeff Thompson of the Art and Art History department on Friday, February 22<sup>nd</sup> at 4:30 pm in Convocation Hall, to be followed by a reception in the lobby of duPont Library at 5:45 pm. Sewanee’s University Jazz Quartet will perform at the reception, and light refreshments will be provided.<a href="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/poster_henderson_morse_horiz.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-594 aligncenter" style="border: 10px solid white; float: center;" title="poster_henderson_morse_horiz" src="http://gallery.sewanee.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/poster_henderson_morse_horiz.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="373" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <em>A Brief History of Aviation</em>, will fill the periodicals area of duPont Library with luminous, soaring fan vaults derived from the 15<sup>th</sup> century architecture of Bath Abbey. Transmuted into glass and carbon fiber, transported into the contemporary world, do these forms still carry the impact of their gothic models; their power to move the viewer? What can they tell us about the revivalist architecture of our own campus? The exhibition of the same name in the Carlos Gallery is dedicated to the evolution of Henderson’s forms, and to his resolutely anti-heroic creative process. His sculptures are monumental in scale, but remarkably lightweight. His forms are resonant with meaning and strikingly beautiful, but he prefers to talk about their materials, and how they were made. Meticulously designed with 3-D modeling programs, they are constructed by hand, preserving the traces of that hands-on process on their surfaces. As David Brody so aptly stated, “In lieu of Big Sculpture’s industrial-strength piety, Henderson gives us the DIY proficiency, and perhaps the true religion, of the backyard rocket scientist.”</p>
<p>Brandon Morse’s<em> Dark Matter</em> will transform the space of the University Art Gallery with hypnotic generative video projections and sound. Entropy and emergence, growth and decay &#8211; physical phenomena are all simulated through digital systems, scientific algorithms, and programming code. Morse’s video simulations at times evoke the atmospheric shifts of weather systems, at times the life and death of underwater creatures. His digital systems are powerfully evocative, and serve as open-ended metaphors for broader social and political issues.</p>
<p>Where Henderson is primarily interested in the concrete facts of materials and structure, Morse explores systems, change, and metaphor. Both, however, experiment with abstract forms, and, more importantly, with how those forms communicate; both create works that envelop the viewer, pulling them into transformative spaces and experiences.</p>
<p>On Saturday, February 23rd, the University of the South will host its 2nd Campus Gallery Walk between 10:30 AM and noon. Visitors are invited to visit <em>Dark Matter</em> and the two parts of <em>A Brief History of Aviation</em>, and also Archives and Special Collections, for <em>Plans and Changes in Sewanee’s Campus</em>, an exhibition of materials related to the revivalist architecture of the University of the South, Sewanee’s very own transformative environment. Come and meet the artists, and explore the dialogue between our four exhibitions and our campus. Complimentary light refreshments will be provided.</p>

<p>Sewanee’s University Art Gallery presents <em>Jessica Wohl: Domestic Disturbance</em>. In the tradition of explorations of the uncanny, Wohl&#8217;s show combines installation and embroidered drawings to pull the viewer into an unsettling domestic environment, at once familiar and alienating. The exhibition will open on November 30<sup>th</sup> at 4:30 p.m. with a reception and a conversation with the artist, led by Dr. Kelly Whitmer of the History Department, in Convocation Hall. Please note that the University Art Gallery will be closed for Winter Break, from December 19<sup>th</sup> through January 14<sup>th</sup>, and will reopen January 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Wohl is fascinated by the disjunction between the glossy perfection of the houses and lives represented in advertising imagery and the conflicts and disappointments of much-less-perfect lived experience. At a time when so many families have lost their homes to the mortgage crisis, Wohl’s work holds up the American Dream of home ownership, and the ideals of security and loving family life associated with that dream, for examination. <em>Domestic Disturbance</em> reminds us that homes, and the people and relationships they contain, can disappoint us, betray us, and hide secrets.</p>
<p>Jessica Wohl was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Growing up in two different suburban households, she was an only child, the youngest child, and the oldest child simultaneously. She received her BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute in 2001 and her MFA from the University of Georgia in 2010. Originally trained as an illustrator, her current studio practice includes drawing, painting, collage, installation and performance.</p>
<p>Wohl is an Assistant Professor of Art, teaching drawing and painting at The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally at venues in New York, Miami, Atlanta, Kansas City, Nashville, Finland, Norway and Italy. She has taught at The University of Georgia, Maple Woods Community College, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art and the Kansas City Art Institute. Her work is represented in the collections of the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, the Sprint-Nextel Corporation, H&amp;R Block World Headquarters, and numerous private collections.</p>
<p>Sewanee’s University Art Gallery is located on Georgia Avenue on the campus of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee.  The gallery is free, accessible, and open to the public. Hours are 10 – 5 Tuesday through Friday and 12 – 4 on Saturday and Sunday.  Please call (931) 598-1223 for more information.</p>
