<p>On July 1, 2014, Andrea D. Lyon, J.D., began her tenure as the twelfth and first female dean of Valparaiso University Law School. Lyon replaced interim dean and longtime faculty member Ivan Bodensteiner, who will be returning to teaching. In her role as dean, Lyon will be responsible for the strategic leadership, coordination, and guidance of the law school. “Practicing law is more than a job, it is a calling, thus Valpo law embraces our theme Valparaiso: Called to the Law” says Lyon. “Valparaiso Law is a community dedicated to excellence in legal education as well as social justice. In short, it is a special place and I’m thrilled to be a part of it.”</p>

<p><a name="2"></a><strong>Etiquette Tip of the Week</strong></p>
<p>From the Culture and Manners Institute<strong> &#8211; </strong><a href="http://app.expressemailmarketing.com/get.link?linkid=6808444&amp;subscriberid=532441318&amp;campaignid=1856958&amp;linkurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cultureandmanners.com%2f">http://www.cultureandmanners.com</a>/</p>
<p><em>What Interviewers Don’t Care About</em></p>
<p>“It&#8217;s time for a little tough love.  This is difficult for me to say, and the last thing I want is for you to take this the wrong way.</p>
<p>But interviewers don&#8217;t care what they can do for you.  There it is.  The skunk is on the table.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t care that the job might be a great stepping stone in your career or that you would have a tremendous sense of accomplishment if you worked for them.</p>
<p>I know!  That&#8217;s so selfish of them, isn&#8217;t it?  Who knew they could be this uncaring and unfeeling?  It&#8217;s all about them.  So typical.</p>
<p>The same for sales relationships &#8212; the person buying products from you doesn&#8217;t care if you meet your next target or that writing a big order would help you buy the new Corvette with the V8 engine and over 600 horsies&#8230; not even if it would get you more dates. (&#8230;or a date.)</p>
<p>Employers and potential customers want to know what you can do for them.</p>
<p>So when writing a cover letter or a sales pitch, don&#8217;t say, &#8220;I feel like this job (or sale) would be a great opportunity for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do say:<br />
&#8220;I know my legal expertise and writing skills would be a great asset to your company.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;With my social media background, I am confident I could help define your target audience and expand your reach.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;These new widget-magidgets will double the productivity of your team and give you more time to focus on distribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now get out there and get that job or land that big contract!  It really is about you, but that can be our little secret.”</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.valpo.edu/law/andrea-d-lyon-j-d-joins-valparaiso-university-law-school-as-the-twelfth-and-first-female-dean"><![CDATA[<p>On July 1, 2014, Andrea D. Lyon, J.D., will begin her tenure as the twelfth and first female dean of Valparaiso University Law School. Lyon will replace interim dean and longtime faculty member Ivan Bodensteiner, who will return to teaching. In her role as dean, Lyon will be responsible for the strategic leadership, coordination, and guidance of the law school. “Practicing law is more than a job, it is a calling, thus Valpo law embraces our theme Valparaiso: Called to the Law” says Lyon. “Valparaiso Law is a community dedicated to excellence in legal education as well as social justice. In short, it is a special place and I’m thrilled to be a part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a great honor to assume the role of dean at Valparaiso Law School,” says Lyon.  “The law school has a terrific faculty and staff, a talented student body and loyal alumni.  To meet the needs of the changing dynamics of the legal profession, the law school has revamped its curriculum to integrate practical skills into doctrinal and clinical courses. Says Lyon, “The enhanced curriculum will help our students gain practical experience in key themes such as advocacy, government and business. The curriculum will help our students fully develop the core competencies required of an entry-level practitioner.”</p>
<p>Andrea Lyon earned her B.A. from Rutgers University and J.D. from Antioch School of Law. Most recently, Lyon served at the DePaul University College of Law in Chicago, where she was the Associate Dean of Clinical Programs and Director of the Center for Justice in Capital Cases. Prior to joining the DePaul University College of Law, Andrea founded the Illinois Capital Resource Center and served as its director until joining the University of Michigan Law School faculty. Andrea began her legal career at the Cook County Public Defender’s Office, where her last position was Chief of the Homicide Task Force.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.valpo.edu/law/valparaiso-law-school-to-host-international-conference"><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, June 28th, Valparaiso University Law School will host scholars from Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Austria and the United States at its Hyde Park, Chicago venue, located on the campus of the Lutheran School of Theology. The conference will focus on Hans Kelsen, considered one of the preeminent jurists of the 20th century. Kelsen was highly influential among scholars of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_law">public law</a> and his influence has been felt in the fields of philosophy, sociology, political theory and international relations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to this day, Kelsen and his ideas are rarely considered in the U.S. legal academy.  “Although Kelsen lived here, published in English and taught at major universities, his work was largely ignored, and today very few lawyers even know who he was,” stated Jeremy Telman, Professor of Law at Valparaiso University.</p>
<p>This two day conference aims to explore the reasons for Kelsen’s lack of influence in the United States and to propose ways in which Kelsen’s approach to legal, political and international relations theory could be relevant to current debates in the United States.</p>

This social network helps lawyers at law firms market their practice to lawyers practicing in-house at companies and non-profit organizations. It also provides a valuable resource for in-house counsel to obtain legal news, developments and CLE offerings on niche areas of law.</p>

The Post Tribune highlights, &#8220;Her mother, Sharon Rae Haws, told the Chicago Sun-Times her daughter grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, loved soccer and dreamed of practicing law. She realized that dream after graduating from Valparaiso University Law School in Indiana in 2012 and moving to Chicago, where she found a job practicing family law at the Davi Law Group. “She loved the big city,” Sharon Rae Haws said. Dion Davi, the founding attorney of the firm where Haws worked, described Haws as a “brilliant rising star in the legal community.” “She was loved by all that met her,” Davi said. “The law profession and the world have lost someone that was destined to do great things.” Our condolences go out to Ashley&#8217;s family.</div>

<p><strong>Etiquette Tips of the Week</strong></p>
<p>From the Culture and Manners Institute<strong> &#8211; </strong><a href="http://app.expressemailmarketing.com/get.link?linkid=6808444&amp;subscriberid=532441318&amp;campaignid=1856958&amp;linkurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cultureandmanners.com%2f">http://www.cultureandmanners.com</a>/<br />
<a name="2"></a><br />
<em>It’s Wise to Personalize</em></p>
<p>Etiquette is about being attentive to the people around us.  Whether writing a follow up thank you letter for an interview or a client meeting, personalize it.  Include details of what you talked about in the meeting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mistake to write a generic thank you that looks like it could have been cut and pasted with different names and companies:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Thank you for telling me more about the position at </em>(fill in the organization).<em>  I feel like my skills would make me a valuable member of your team.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Make the person feel like you are talking to him/her and not just anyone:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I was inspired by your story about how you started out in manufacturing&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You are interested in a greater online presence for your athletic clothing line, and I have proven experience in growing several student organizations through social media.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Attached is the online advertising information we talked about.  Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I enjoyed meeting you and Manny Products, your Vice President of Consumer Research.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I will follow up with you on the week of June 8th.  Congratulations on your first grandchild and enjoy your time off.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The most valuable part of personalizing a business letter?  It says to the person, <em>&#8220;I was listening.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Great…once you get to know them</em></p>
<p>Last week, I had some down time on a speaking trip to Los Angeles, so I sat in on some Toastmasters club meetings.  A young man named Travis Jones at the Claremont Foothills Toastmasters at Claremont Graduate University said this: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be the guy who people say, &#8216;He&#8217;s a great guy&#8230; <em>once you get to know him</em>.&#8217;  I want to be the great guy from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is what first impressions are &#8212; doing what you can so people think well of you from the start.</p>
<p>At a networking event, very rarely will someone take you by the arm and say, &#8220;Let me introduce you to the most fabulous people in the room.&#8221;  Networking takes effort on your part. (There is a reason &#8220;working&#8221; is the root word here.)</p>
<p>If you see someone standing alone, introduce yourself.  &#8220;Hello, my name is (first name, last name).&#8221;  The person who introduces himself/herself is more memorable than someone who hangs back and waits to be introduced.</p>
<p>When the person offers his/her name, say, &#8220;How do you do, (name)?&#8221;</p>
<p>When you see a group of people talking, stand outside the group until you hear a lull in the conversation, then step forward and introduce yourself.</p>
<p>To keep a conversation going, ask questions of the other person.  People will appreciate you when you take an interest in them.</p>
<p>Be the person people want to know from the start:<br />
Make eye contact with people in the room and not with your cell phone.</p>
<p>Smile &#8212; this shows you are open to communication.</p>
<p>Dress so people respect you&#8230; <em>not inspect you</em>.  If you show too much skin (you too, Mr. Saggy Britches), the right people will avoid you and the wrong people won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Did you know anyone can visit a Toastmasters meeting?  Check <a href="http://app.expressemailmarketing.com/get.link?linkid=6859136&amp;subscriberid=532441318&amp;campaignid=1871514&amp;linkurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.toastmasters.org">www.toastmasters.org</a> to see what clubs are in your area.</p>
<p><em>Emailing the CEO</em></p>
<p>The higher a person is in an organization, the shorter the email response.  Some shift through hundreds of emails a day.  So if you email your plan to a CEO or VP and he/she gives you a one sentence response instead of the paragraph-by-paragraph, thoughtful analysis you were craving, it&#8217;s not personal.  It&#8217;s a time thing.</p>
<p>Digital communication is rapid and allows us to make contact from anywhere. (Even Antler, ND has wi-fi, don&#8217;t cha know.)  We fire off emails quickly.  That&#8217;s also how we read them.</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t read every word in an email, they skim it.  Write emails with that in mind.<br />
1) State your purpose early.<br />
2) Mention attachments early. (As soon as you type, &#8220;attached,&#8221; attach the document so you don&#8217;t forget.)<br />
3) After you draft it&#8230; half it.  Eliminate excess words.</p>
<p>Etiquette is about being attentive to others, so when you write, write with the other person in mind.<br />

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.valpo.edu/law/valparaiso-law-changes-name-of-highly-successful-professionalism-series"><![CDATA[<p>Starting this fall, Valparaiso University Law School is changing the name of its highly successful Professionalism Series to honor longtime faculty member and former dean Louis F. Bartelt, Jr. Dean Bartelt served on Valparaiso’s faculty from 1948 until 1986, as dean from 1964 to 1969, and was the recipient of the school’s first endowed chair.</p>
<p>The Professionalism Series was established at the law school in 2012 and was designed to communicate the values and ideals of the legal profession to students and equip them with the skills and attitudes that will be expected of them upon graduation. Functioning like a continuing legal education requirement, all students are required to attend one program in the Professionalism Series each semester they are enrolled at Valparaiso Law to fulfill a professionalism education requirement needed for graduation.</p>
<p>General topics for the Professionalism series include legal ethics, professional judgment, the practice of law, the importance of civility, wellness, substance abuse, diversity, communication skills, and networking. The Professionalism Series is administered by Assistant Dean for Students Steve Probst who often partners with local attorneys and judges to present programming for the series. “We’ve found a great deal of support in the local legal community for this project” says Probst. “Attorneys and judges are very interested in helping to shape the professional attitudes of new attorneys.” “Much of the content we’re presenting in these program used to be picked up along the way by students during summer associateships or in the early years of their careers. However, as the legal economy has changed, law firms now seem to expect our graduates to come to them more practice-ready, including the acquisition of these soft-skills our students are exposed to in our Professionalism Series.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Valparaiso University Law School</strong></p>
<p>For more than 130 years, Valparaiso University Law School has empowered talented individuals to realize personal and professional success. Nine “live client” clinics, a nationally recognized externship program, and a commitment to innovation, highlight a program of education that serves as both a path to a career and a path to personal and professional growth.

<strong>Etiquette Tips of the Week</strong></p>
<p><em>Punctuation for Your Salutation</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cultureandmanners.com/">For More Information Click Here</a></p>
<p>When writing a business letter or business email, begin with the &#8220;salutation.&#8221;  When should you use a colon and when should you use a comma in a salutation?</p>
<p>With a formal business letter or email, especially when contacting someone you don&#8217;t know, use a colon.</p>
<p><em>Dear Ms. Honeybun:</em></p>
<p>With people who are more familiar to you, you may use a colon or a comma.</p>
<p><em>Dear Mr. Sugarpie, or Dear John,</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Mr. Sugarpie: or Dear John:</em></p>
<p>Even less formal:</p>
<p><em>Hi, Lambchop, or Hello, Lambchop,</em></p>
<p><em>Lambchop</em>  —</p>
<p>With people who are completely unfamiliar:</p>
<p><em>To The Consumer Affairs Department:</em></p>
<p>Always try to find the name of the person you are trying to reach.  Avoid, &#8220;To whom it may concern.&#8221;  It may not concern anyone.</p>
<p><em>The Three Most Commonly-Made Smartphone Faux Pas</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Using your smartphone during meetings and business meals.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Making more eye contact with your device than with people in elevators and other common areas.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Reacting to messages as they are received rather than responding to them periodically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Manage your smartphone communication rather than letting it control you!</p>
