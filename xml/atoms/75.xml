My father, William Kneeland Jr., DMSB’67, worked at the university for nearly 30 years, the last five as its treasurer. To me, he is Northeastern. He is a great role model, and I always wanted to be like him. I even thought that I’d take over his job when he retired. When the time came for me to go to college, there was no question where I’d go.

Co-op was an important part of my Northeastern experience. My co-op adviser, Bill Sloane, was instrumental in identifying opportunities that matched my interests, and in helping me land those jobs. In both my middler and my senior years I worked at Canby Maloney &amp; Company, a 30-person accounting firm in Framingham, Mass. Those co-ops equipped me with the tools for success. I not only gained training in tax accounting, but also learned how to work hard in a professional environment. Post-graduation, I landed a position at Canby, now BDO Seidman, and stayed on for three years.

In 2010, I was elated to be hired by Northeastern’s accounting office as an operational accountant. My dream of working at the university—like my dad—had come full circle.

Beyond my job, I remain engaged with Northeastern through athletics. When I was younger, my dad brought me to ice hockey and basketball games. (My favorite player was and forever will be Reggie Lewis.) I attended winter Sunday morning baseball clinics in Cabot with Coach Neil McPhee, and at summer basketball camps we trained on the corner where the Marino Center now sits. I continue to root for the Huskies, particularly at Beanpot.

Northeastern is a deep and important part of who I am. Because it’s given me so much, investing in the university with gifts to the athletic department has been an easy decision—and the right choice. I truly love Northeastern and want it to grow even stronger and better in the years to come.

In this respect, I was fortunate.

When I was five, my family emigrated from Sri Lanka, and I grew up in Lexington, Massachusetts. My dad worked in information technology while my mom pursued a banking career. After graduating from Lexington High School in 1993, I began the pre-med track at Boston University. But in my freshman year, the dot-com bubble burst, and the recession hit—and both my parents lost their jobs.

I was forced to decide whether to continue with college. It’s hard to be sure of a career path at age 18, and I didn’t want to waste money while I figured it out. Searching for adventure and a new career path, I moved to Austria and landed a job teaching English to businesspeople. There I was, living in a foreign country, learning to take care of myself. It forced me to grow up quickly.

I returned to the U.S. and began working at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in sales and marketing in late 2000. Eventually I was given the valuable opportunity to present healthcare plans to major corporate clients. Thanks to a director who saw potential in me, I was accepted into a management training program and was motivated to go back to school.

At Northeastern’s University College, now the College of Professional Studies (CPS), the first person I met was a professor and academic adviser, Robert Heron, MEd’71, EdD’86. I wasn’t sure that I’d be able to complete my bachelor’s after having interrupted my educational journey, but I was determined. Due in large part to Dr. Heron’s guidance and belief in me, I finished my bachelor’s degree in finance and business administration while working full-time and later earned my executive MBA from Northeastern. Soon after completing my MBA, I moved to California to be with my future wife. I looked up to and trusted Dr. Heron, and we remained friends until his passing in 2010.

Today, I work at Kaiser Permanente in its IT Infrastructure Management Group, providing technology, systems architecture, and information security services across the healthcare organization’s 38 hospitals and 618 medical offices, which serve over 9.3 million members.

Northeastern is part of our life, our story. It’s ingrained in our DNA. Recently I made a gift in Dr. Heron’s memory to the CPS Excellence Fund, which supports student scholarships. I wanted to help students who can benefit from the support, encouragement, and high standards of excellence that my own mentors expected of me.

Northeastern has made a difference in many lives, and the collective power of these personal stories is very real and extraordinary. I encourage alumni to reconnect with the university and find a way to “pay it forward,” so other deserving students can benefit from the opportunities provided by a high-quality education.

Up until that time I had learned much and had kept my co-op reflections in a diary, but I had not yet found the perfect career path.  I wanted to try a research position that had the potential for helping people, and Professor Caruso guided me to it.

She told me that Professor Bertram Scharf in the Psychology Department had just obtained funding from the National Institutes of Heath related to how people perceive and interpret sounds, and that he would probably be hiring an assistant. She encouraged me to talk with him about my former co-op at the MITRE Corporation with Lincoln Laboratories, in Bedford, Massachusetts, where I had worked as a research assistant writing computer programs for the study of human behavior.

My first meeting with Professor Scharf was memorable. As he talked with me, he ate his lunch and read an article, a sandwich in one hand, his journal in the other. He asked me some tough questions related to statistical methods, but I was too curious to be intimidated. He told me to come back in a week, which I did, bringing questions of my own. “You ask good questions,” he said, adding that I might make yet another appointment with him for the following week.

Professor Caruso gave me the push I needed to return a third time, and that is how my fruitful decades-long research collaboration with Professor Scharf started. Years later—after earning my doctorate at Northeastern, working as a scientist at MIT, and returning to Northeastern in 1980—I asked him why he had hired me. “It is not enough to be clever and ask good questions,” he replied. “Great scientists must be persistent.”

Today, I am the <i>George J. &amp; Kathleen Walters Matthews Distinguished Professor</i> at Northeastern, enjoying my ideal career—one that began as a co-op in Professor Scharf’s laboratory. My research is focused on loudness, hearing loss, and the relationship between physical acoustics of sound and our individual perceptions of it. For more than 30 years, I have taken great pleasure in interdisciplinary teaching, involving students from health sciences, engineering, and psychology. By listening to my students, I have learned how to teach them; each brings a different perspective. Some of my students have grown into colleagues, which is a special delight.

Whenever people ask me about Northeastern’s co-op program, I say that I owe my career satisfaction to co-op and my adviser, Professor Nancy Caruso. I have hired many wonderful co-op students on my NIH-funded grants in the course of almost 25 years. I ask each to keep a co-op diary of lessons learned and personal reflections, which becomes a basis for our weekly chats.

Whenever I talk with students, I am always careful to look them in the eye—and to not eat and read at the same time!

		<category scheme="http://www.northeastern.edu/empower" term="News" />		<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img width="617" height="435" src="http://www.northeastern.edu/empower/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/W2020_29_14.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Spencer Fung CEO" /></p>Think about how you got the jeans you’re wearing. As the con­sumer, your role was pretty simple: You went to the store, tried them on, flashed the plastic, and left with your pur­chase. But that’s merely the tail end of a mas­sive, com­plex global process that brought those jeans from ini­tial design to man­u­fac­turing to the store where you found them.

Spencer Fung, PA’96, group chief oper­ating officer and exec­u­tive director of Li &amp; Fung, is immersed in this intri­cate process. He heads up global infra­struc­ture for Li &amp; Fung, a multi­na­tional group head­quar­tered in Hong Kong that engages in the design, devel­op­ment, sourcing, and dis­tri­b­u­tion of con­sumer goods world­wide. The com­pany man­ages end-​​to-​​end supply chains to con­nect more than 7,000 retailers and 15,000 sup­pliers glob­ally through three busi­ness net­works com­prising trading, logis­tics, and distribution.

Fung, who is also a member of Northeastern’s Board of Trustees, spoke at the university’s CEO International Forum in Hong Kong on May 28.

In his talk titled “New par­a­digms in global sourcing,” Fung described how the family busi­ness was founded in 1906, its global expan­sion over gen­er­a­tions, China’s labor force, and the chal­lenges and oppor­tu­ni­ties facing the com­pany today.

He said numerous fac­tors shape the global sourcing arena, including the price of raw mate­rials, wages, demo­graphics, trade rela­tions, and polit­ical and eco­nomic sta­bility. This all makes for a mul­ti­fac­eted global supply chain that’s evolving daily and facing new chal­lenges and opportunities—whether it be con­sumer trends or needs, regional trade agree­ments, pro­to­cols due to wage infla­tion, or safety mea­sures fol­lowing last year’s deadly col­lapse of a Bangladesh clothing factory.

“If you look at the global sourcing land­scape, there is no con­stant. Almost every week you’re reacting to some­thing,” Fung said. “You have to be nimble, fast, and flex­ible to be able to change almost on the fly. Oth­er­wise you’ll have no goods to sell, and you’ll have no jeans to wear.”

In wel­come remarks, North­eastern Pres­i­dent Joseph E. Aoun ref­er­enced the impact Fung said his own inter­na­tional co-​​op expe­ri­ence had on his career. Aoun also lauded the oppor­tu­ni­ties Li &amp; Fung has been pro­viding North­eastern stu­dents with in Hong Kong. North­eastern is a global leader in expe­ri­en­tial edu­ca­tion anchored in its sig­na­ture co-​​op pro­gram. Since 2006, stu­dents have com­pleted expe­ri­en­tial learning oppor­tu­ni­ties in 114 countries.

“We need to increase the oppor­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents to go over­seas because we want them to be exploring the world and becoming global cit­i­zens,” Aoun said.

For his part, Fung’s job requires him to be closely in tune with the global busi­ness world, or risk Li &amp; Fung falling behind its com­peti­tors. Along with keeping up with tra­di­tional fac­tors that affect the global supply chain, Fung pointed to new forces coming into the fold. Social media has driven com­pa­nies to be more trans­parent. The “fast fashion” trend has trans­formed the industry by dra­mat­i­cally shrinking the pro­duc­tion cycle and forcing industry to churn out new clothing options much more quickly than ever before. And omni-​​channel retailing pro­vides a seam­less, inte­grated cus­tomer expe­ri­ence that today’s con­sumers expect.

Fung said pre­dicting the impact of emerging fac­tors isn’t easy; rather, the key is set­ting up an infra­struc­ture that can react swiftly to them. To that end, he called 3-​​D printing “the biggest unknown.”

“Right now, it’s a hobby for enthu­si­asts or pro­to­typing, but who knows about tomorrow?” he said. “I can imagine a day when there are fac­to­ries in Mexico or North Car­olina with thou­sands of 3-​​D printers mass pro­ducing prod­ucts for the con­sumer and cus­tomizing every­thing. You can even do it at home. What will that do to global supply chains? There are huge social implications.”

In a Q-​​and-​​A fol­lowing his talk, Fung fielded inquires on topics ranging from the work-​​life bal­ance to family busi­nesses. One attendee asked him to name the biggest com­pet­i­tive pres­sure facing his busi­ness. In response, Fung said, “Our industry is highly frag­mented around the world. … As large as we are as a com­pany, we have a small share of global sourcing. Com­pe­ti­tion is every­where.” He added: “Being able to com­pete with these small– and medium-​​sized entre­pre­neurial quick-​​moving units is what we’re going against.”

Wednesday’s event coin­cided with the launch of Northeastern’s his­toric Empower cam­paign in Hong Kong. Launched one year ago, <i>Empower: The Cam­paign for North­eastern Uni­ver­sity</i>, is a com­pre­hen­sive fundraising drive to secure $1 bil­lion in sup­port of pro­grams and ini­tia­tives, with a par­tic­ular focus on three strategic goals: stu­dent finan­cial sup­port and finan­cial aid, fac­ulty advance­ment and expan­sion, and inno­va­tion in edu­ca­tion and research.

As the con­sumer, your role was pretty simple: You went to the store, tried them on, flashed the plastic, and left with your pur­chase. But that’s merely the tail end of a mas­sive, com­plex global process that brought those jeans from ini­tial design to man­u­fac­turing to the store where you found them.

Spencer Fung, PA’96, group chief oper­ating officer and exec­u­tive director of Li &amp; Fung, is immersed in this intri­cate process. He heads up global infra­struc­ture for Li &amp; Fung, a multi­na­tional group head­quar­tered in Hong Kong that engages in the design, devel­op­ment, sourcing, and dis­tri­b­u­tion of con­sumer goods world­wide. The com­pany man­ages end-​​to-​​end supply chains to con­nect more than 7,000 retailers and 15,000 sup­pliers glob­ally through three busi­ness net­works com­prising trading, logis­tics, and distribution.

Fung, who is also a member of Northeastern’s Board of Trustees, spoke at the university’s CEO International Forum in Hong Kong on May 28.

In his talk titled “New par­a­digms in global sourcing,” Fung described how the family busi­ness was founded in 1906, its global expan­sion over gen­er­a­tions, China’s labor force, and the chal­lenges and oppor­tu­ni­ties facing the com­pany today.

He said numerous fac­tors shape the global sourcing arena, including the price of raw mate­rials, wages, demo­graphics, trade rela­tions, and polit­ical and eco­nomic sta­bility. This all makes for a mul­ti­fac­eted global supply chain that’s evolving daily and facing new chal­lenges and opportunities—whether it be con­sumer trends or needs, regional trade agree­ments, pro­to­cols due to wage infla­tion, or safety mea­sures fol­lowing last year’s deadly col­lapse of a Bangladesh clothing factory.

“If you look at the global sourcing land­scape, there is no con­stant. Almost every week you’re reacting to some­thing,” Fung said. “You have to be nimble, fast, and flex­ible to be able to change almost on the fly. Oth­er­wise you’ll have no goods to sell, and you’ll have no jeans to wear.”

In wel­come remarks, North­eastern Pres­i­dent Joseph E. Aoun ref­er­enced the impact Fung said his own inter­na­tional co-​​op expe­ri­ence had on his career. Aoun also lauded the oppor­tu­ni­ties Li &amp; Fung has been pro­viding North­eastern stu­dents with in Hong Kong. North­eastern is a global leader in expe­ri­en­tial edu­ca­tion anchored in its sig­na­ture co-​​op pro­gram. Since 2006, stu­dents have com­pleted expe­ri­en­tial learning oppor­tu­ni­ties in 114 countries.

“We need to increase the oppor­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents to go over­seas because we want them to be exploring the world and becoming global cit­i­zens,” Aoun said.

When George J. Kostas, E’43, first began con­ver­sa­tions with North­eastern Pres­i­dent Joseph E. Aoun six years ago about estab­lishing a state-​​of-​​the-​​art secu­rity research facility, he had a unique vision. The facility—which ulti­mately opened in 2011 as the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/kostas/" target="_blank">George J. Kostas Research Insti­tute for Home­land Secu­rity</a>—would go beyond advancing sci­ence and research in one of the nation’s most pressing fields. It would also enable unlikely industry-​​academic partnerships.

“Today, your vision is becoming a reality,” Aoun said on Tuesday, March 25 at a ribbon-​​cutting cer­e­mony cel­e­brating the opening of the Rogers Cor­po­ra­tion Inno­va­tion Center at the 70,000 square foot Kostas Research Insti­tute in Burlington, Mass. The goal of the unique part­ner­ship—<a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/news/2013/07/northeastern-launches-joint-innovation-center-with-rogers-corporation/" target="_blank">announced in June 2013</a>—is to advance basic research and develop com­mer­cially viable break­through inno­va­tions in advanced mate­rials to address global chal­lenges for clean energy, Internet con­nec­tivity, safety, and security.

“Inno­va­tion and cre­ativity are the basis for the future of this country,” Kostas said. “You have estab­lished a rep­u­ta­tion of being great inno­va­tors.” The dis­tinc­tive col­lab­o­ra­tion, he said, will improve secu­rity for the nation.

The 4,000-square-foot Rogers Cor­po­ra­tion Inno­va­tion Center was built out over the last year. It is housed within a 9,000-square-foot space at the Kostas Research Insti­tute that includes lab­o­ra­to­ries, con­fer­ence rooms, and office space designed to facil­i­tate com­mu­ni­ca­tion and col­lab­o­ra­tion between the on-​​site Rogers staff mem­bers and the North­eastern fac­ulty and stu­dents working along­side them. It includes space for North­eastern pro­fessor Vin­cent Harris’ spinout company.

With sup­port from Kostas’ endow­ment, the partnership—which is expected to be the first of many at the institute—will also enable expe­ri­en­tial learning oppor­tu­ni­ties through stu­dent research co-​​ops, spon­sored research and devel­op­ment pro­grams, and other industry-​​classroom interactions.

Since its incep­tion more than 180 years ago as a paper com­pany, Rogers Cor­po­ra­tion has had to evolve to accom­mo­date the shifting needs of the Amer­ican people. Today, the com­pany is a global tech­nology leader in advanced mate­rials and com­po­nents for con­sumer and power elec­tronics, trans­porta­tion, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, and defense systems.

Rogers CEO Bruce Hoechner noted that per­haps the biggest evolution—and revolution—facing society today is tech­nology. In an effort to match the pace of tech­no­log­ical change, the com­pany sought an aca­d­emic partner to help it inno­vate more rapidly. Hoechner said Rogers was drawn to North­eastern because of its com­mit­ment to use-​​inspired research that addresses global challenges—particularly in health, secu­rity, and sustainability.
<div id="stcpDiv">

“We felt very much at home here,” Hoechner said. “We knew that we could find an aca­d­emic orga­ni­za­tion here that was not only focused on devel­oping new and great tech­nology but also tech­nology that has great appli­ca­tion for the world.”

Aoun, for his part, noted that uni­ver­si­ties have tra­di­tion­ally shied away from industry part­ner­ships. As a result, “they have restricted their impact on society,” he said. “This is why I’m very excited about this partnership—yes it’s unique, but it’s going to bring us together along dif­ferent dimensions.”

First, Aoun said, the dis­cov­eries and tech­nolo­gies devel­oped in uni­ver­si­ties only have impact when they meet the con­sumer. Second, lifting finan­cial burden off of researchers enables a reverse inno­va­tion that allows prod­ucts to enter the market more rapidly.

“We have to have a mindset that will bring together tech­nology, con­sumers, cost, and—more importantly—the safety of the nation,” he said.

By the time I was a high school senior, I was running a thriving IT support company and building websites for dozens of customers. Being an entrepreneur is about exploring the world of ideas, and I chose Northeastern because the co-op program and city of Boston offer precisely that opportunity.

When I arrived on campus in 2008, the Boston-based venture capital firm .406 Ventures was hiring undergraduates to help identify student-run companies they could invest in. Northeastern’s Entrepreneurs Club faculty adviser, Professor Gordon Adomdza, recommended me for the job. I learned about the entrepreneurship and venture capital processes from an investor’s point of view, all while I was a freshman. It was an incredible experience.

A few years later, while president of the Entrepreneurs Club, I came up with the idea for Attend.com. The club’s events drew hundreds of attendees, and I’d look into the sea of faces and wonder, “Who are these students? Are they freshmen? Are they business majors?” So I built a software prototype for a laptop or tablet to serve as a check-in kiosk: Guests signed into an event, and the computer prompted them to share their major and graduation year. From the data, the software calculated audience demographics.

Attend.com is a classic Northeastern entrepreneurship story because it was born within the university’s walls. Our first customer was the Office of Alumni Relations, and the software spread quickly. In March 2013, my business partner, Drew D’Agostino, DMSB’12, and I had no salaries and one customer. Less than 12 months later, we hired our twenty-first employee! What makes the story particularly exciting is that Attend.com landed a $1 million investment from .406 Ventures in June 2013 and now is growing fast.

Northeastern’s faculty and staff have been pivotal supporters. In particular, Director of Communications for Alumni Relations Anthony Donaldson has been a vital coach and mentor. He was one of the first people I pitched Attend.com to, and he’s shared invaluable insights from a technical and career perspective.

The idea of creating something from nothing keeps me driven—that Attend.com is changing the way people work is thrilling to me. If you have the ambition to turn an idea into a reality, Northeastern gives you every tool to do just that.

Attend.com is a classic Northeastern entrepreneurship story because it was born within the university’s walls. Our first customer was the Office of Alumni Relations, and the software spread quickly. In March 2013, my business partner, Drew D’Agostino, DMSB’12, and I had no salaries and one customer. Less than 12 months later, we hired our twenty-first employee! What makes the story particularly exciting is that Attend.com landed a $1 million investment from .406 Ventures in June 2013 and now is growing fast.

Northeastern’s faculty and staff have been pivotal supporters. In particular, Director of Communications for Alumni Relations Anthony Donaldson has been a vital coach and mentor. He was one of the first people I pitched Attend.com to, and he’s shared invaluable insights from a technical and career perspective.

The idea of creating something from nothing keeps me driven—that Attend.com is changing the way people work is thrilling to me. If you have the ambition to turn an idea into a reality, Northeastern gives you every tool to do just that.

As a freshman, I landed a work-study job with Undergraduate Admissions and the Visitor Center. I began memorizing Northeastern facts and figures, and by spring I was trained to give tours. This was two parts terrifying, one part exhilarating—but I was hooked immediately. Three years later, I remain a proud Husky Ambassador.

But how did this experience empower me? By teaching me admissions statistics and Northeastern history? (Ask me anything.) Well, no. It was the people.

Let’s start with Andrew Cameron. A loud, second-year business major who always had a joke or a sassy remark, he offered tips for giving better tours plus advice on classes and co-op. Andrew is the comedian and helping hand at the Visitor Center who’s taught me to invest my whole self and heart into the Husky Ambassador’s role.

Then there are Jennifer Cordero, Michelle McDermott, and Leigh McNamara. These women worked with me that first year and showed me how sisterhood could be a positive force in my life. Charismatic and, like Andrew, helpful, their stories empowered me to go through sorority recruitment, where I found myself yet another Northeastern family.

There are others, too—Nyera Yousef, Rachel Weiss, John Leo, Ryan Gordon, Victoria Hanau, Hannah Becker—and so many more who’ve shared their stories with me. Husky Ambassadors have a mantra: “We all have stories to tell. What will yours be?” These people, all 300 and more, have shared their passions, background, and experiences with me, as well as with visitors on our campus tours.

It’s hard not to be empowered by Northeastern students. Like me, they have lived amazing lives so far. And, like me, they believe in the power of sharing.

As I get ready to head to New York City, I’ll be collecting more stories like my own to share.
