<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">But not&nbsp;among the cast, made up entirely of IUP student actors. In them you'll find&nbsp;just&nbsp;dedication, hard work,&nbsp;talent, and a love of&nbsp;theater.</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">What's it like to be a student AND an actor at IUP? We asked Joe York (photo, right), who plays Freddie.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">"One thing you can't do is procrastinate," says York<em>. </em>"You have to be on top of your game 24-7 to be able to balance school work and rehearsals and stay healthy. And you need to be willing to give up your social life."</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">Indeed. The student-actors&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">rehearse at least four hours a day during the week and maybe six hours on the weekends, York says. Preparation usually begins two months before opening night.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">York, a senior <a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=7721">musical theater</a> major from Rolling Springs, enjoys all kinds of theater, but especially musical theater and opera productions.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">He says he's been in "too many IUP theater productions to count." If he had to name a favorite? "Probably <em>Chess</em>. Or <em>White Christmas</em>."</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">Why does he spend the hours, giving up his free time, for IUP theater?</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">"I&nbsp;love it. It's my favorite thing. If I didn't have theater, I'm not sure&nbsp;what I'd do."</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">York will&nbsp;graduate in May and plans to pursue an MFA&nbsp;in&nbsp;musical theater playwriting.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">The production is directed by Jeannie-Marie Brown with musical direction by <a href="http://www.arts.iup.edu/facmus/sjmantel/">Sarah Mantel</a>.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri">"<em>Chess</em> is a very abstract piece," Brown notes, "requiring a great deal of research prior to even beginning rehearsals.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">"The students have worked incredibly hard, negotiating through their own class schedules and rehearsals. They have been present and attentive, and that is why we've been able to realize the vision for this production."</p></font>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri"><em>Chess</em>, which&nbsp;features hit songs including <em>One Night</em></font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Calibri"><em>&nbsp;in Bangkok</em>, <em>I Know Him So Well</em> and <em>Pity the Child</em>, will close this weekend with shows at 8:00 p.m. Thursday,&nbsp; Friday, and Satuday.

        <![CDATA[<p>The Scottish explorer and abolitionist Dr. David Livingstone was immortalized&nbsp;by the words&nbsp;fellow explorer Henry Morton Stanley uttered on a chance encounter in Tanzania in 1871: "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?"</p>
<p>As it turns out,&nbsp;Livingstone was not quite as historians have presumed.</p>
<p><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px 20px; FLOAT: right" class="mt-image-right" alt="wisnicki_table_280.jpg" src="http://blog.iup.edu/aroundtheoakgrove/wisnicki_table_280.jpg" width="280" height="213" />A&nbsp;team of experts led by IUP's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=116707">Adrian Wisnicki</a>, assistant professor of <a href="http://www.iup.edu/english/default.aspx">English</a>&nbsp;(left, photo), has used spectral imaging to recover text from Livingstone's original journals that disputes the edited official journals and helps historians to know&nbsp;the REAL&nbsp;Livingstone.</p>
<p>On February 29, 2012 at 5:30 p.m., Wisnicki and his team, which includes&nbsp;two scientists and IUP doctoral student A.J. Schmitz (right, photo), will present a<a href="http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=124252&amp;blogid=6121"> panel discussion </a>on how they recovered the text from the original journals. </p>
<p>This will be the first time&nbsp;the team&nbsp;presents about the project in the United States. When they presented their findings in November in England, they made international news headlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Livingstone Spectral Imaging Project: Behind the Scenes" panel discussion is&nbsp;free and open to the community. It will be held in the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/library/">IUP Libraries</a>&nbsp;(ground floor).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2009, Wisnicki, who specializes in British literature, found pages from Livingstone's original diary in an unmarked box in Scotland. He worked with a team of scholars, including Roger L. Easton Jr. from the Rochester Institute of Technology and Mike Toth from R.B. Toth Associates, to make the original journal pages legible. Easton and Toth will speak as part of&nbsp; the panel at IUP.</p>
<p>Wisnicki compares the technology they used to the science in the movie&nbsp;<em>National Treasure, </em>in which Nicholas Cage recovers the&nbsp;"real"&nbsp;Declaration of Independence. </p>
<p>Of course, the science to recover the Livingstone journals is&nbsp;real.</p>
<p>As a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/12057/1212470-44.stm">great story in Pittsburgh Post Gazette </a>notes, "Besides providing scholars with new information about Livingstone's adventures, reactions and comments about African culture, the project also advertises the potential of spectral imaging to transcribe illegible manuscripts written on paper, parchment, animal skins or other surfaces."</p>
<p>"It's&nbsp;been an extremely exciting project, not only because of what we have learned about Livingstone, but because of how technology and science have helped us to make this discovery," Wisnicki says.</p>
<p>At noon on Wednesday, March 1,&nbsp;the day after the&nbsp;panel discussion,&nbsp;Easton will present a program in the IUP Libraries about his work to recover text written by the philosopher and scientist Archimedes.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching, Wisnicki is codirector of IUP's <a href="http://www.iup.edu/digitalhumanities/">Center for Digital Humanities and Culture</a>. He believes that his work with the Livingstone journals fits into the work being done by the center.</p>
<p>"Projects like this show the importance of centers like this, recognizing that technology is part of academic work across all disciplines."</p>
<p>It's especially exciting to see how&nbsp;experts from the humanities and sciences, by&nbsp;working together,&nbsp;literally rewrite history.</p>]]>

<p class="introduction">And&nbsp;they are REALLY in the spotlight!</p>
<p class="introduction">In addition to a great&nbsp;photo of the students in the chapter, the publication has a full-page of Q&amp;A about the chapter activities and an interview with <a href="http://nsm1.nsm.iup.edu/nate/">Professor Nathan McElroy</a>, the chapter's advisor for the past six years. </p>
<p class="introduction">The article showcases many of the chapter's projects and initiatives. This group offers free chemistry tutoring four nights a week, raises funds with weekly sales of hot dogs and T-shirts and uses these funds to&nbsp;make an annual donation of $1,000 to a local elementary or high school science program. The group also participates in local science fairs and recruiting events, including National Chemistry Week at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="introduction">McElroy, who is an IUP&nbsp;alumnus, was secretary of the Chemistry Club&nbsp;as a student.&nbsp;When he returned&nbsp;to IUP as a faculty member, he said, "I asked to become the advisor."</p>
<p class="introduction">When asked about advice for new club advisors, he suggested, "Don't underestimate your students' creativity."</p>
<p class="introduction">Clearly, it's a formula that works. </p>]]>

<p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style=""></span>I see, and I'm sure you do, too, how students in my classes need support, and I see how they benefit from scholarships that come from private gifts. I was moved enough by what one of my own teachers did for me to find inspiration to <a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=123905">start in his memory a scholarship fund</a> in the Foundation for IUP. Very soon, that fund will supply scholarship awards to <a href="http://www.iup.edu/pse">Education</a> majors.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The fund didn't start with one big gift. I started the scholarship by making small gifts to the fund myself and seeking small gifts from friends and family. From that experience, I learned that it takes participation from many and not necessarily large donations, to make that difference--although large donations are always welcome! It's not unlike voting--we all know that every vote counts in an election. A gift is an endorsement that illustrates we believe in what we do. <a href="http://www.iup.edu/taxonomy.aspx?taxID=6269">Your gift can be designated to whatever cause inspires you</a>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As chair of this year's campaign, I believe in the power of what our private gifts can do.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In case you think your participation doesn't count, I want to share with you the following e-mail message, sent to our Annual Giving Office from a student who missed the chance to stop by the HUB on <a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=103370">Tuition Freedom Day</a> to write out a thank-you card to a donor. She asked that her message be sent to those who had contributed to IUP:</span></p>

<p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><i style=""><span style="">"I want to thank you for all of your contributions and your hearts of gold.

<p>Now, IUP&nbsp;junior, senior, and graduate students in the top 10 percent of their classes have the chance to join this most excellent chapter.</p>
<p>The honor society recently sent membership invitations to 430 undergraduate students and&nbsp;557 graduate students, mailing the invitations to the students' home addresses on record with the university. </p>
<p>The IUP chapter will have two initiation ceremonies: March 28 for undergraduate students and April 3 for graduate students. Both ceremonies will be held from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. in the Blue Room, Sutton Hall.</p>
<p>Students may accept the invitation to join by mailing in a form or completing one&nbsp;on the web&nbsp;and should indicate whether they will attend the ceremony -- for undergraduates, the deadline is March 7; for graduate students, March 13.</p>
<p>"We really hope that all invited students respond to this invitation -- it's a wonderful opportunity for students to be part of a national network of scholars," said Professor Dennis Giever, IUP chapter president.</p>
<p>In addition, he notes that "Phi Kappa Phi has more than $700,000 in scholarships and graduate fellowships for its members nationally, and several&nbsp;IUP students have been selected for these awards since IUP's chapter was chartered in 1993." </p>
<p>He asks that faculty&nbsp;encourage invited students to reply. "We know that students get inundated with information and mailings, but this&nbsp;is something that&nbsp;can be of great benefit to&nbsp;them, especially if they have an interest in scholarships or graduate fellowships."</p>
<p>Check&nbsp;your mail. You are already a winner!&nbsp;</p>]]>

<p>Not only does the&nbsp;series, presented by the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/international/default.aspx">IUP Office of International Education</a>, show great&nbsp;films from all over the world,&nbsp;it also features <em>musicians</em> from&nbsp;all over the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>And it's all free! </p>
<p>Screenings are&nbsp;every other Sunday night, with each film shown twice, at 5:30 and 8:00 p.m., in McVitty Auditorium, Sprowls Hall. All films are in native languages with English subtitles. The series is open to the public.</p>
<p>The series begins with&nbsp;the guitar and vocal duo of Pengfei Yi and Yuxiang Qiu, students from China, performing in conjunction with the screening of&nbsp;<em>I Bring What I Love,</em> a portrait of Senegalese pop sensation Youssou N'Dour, this Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kittiphong "Mu" Praphan, a student from Thailand, will play guitar for the Argentinian movie <em>The Paranoids on </em>March 4. Mu (short for "music," he notes)&nbsp;is well known on campus, having played at&nbsp;the 2011 Foreign Film and Music Series, International Lunch Hour, and other community events.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.people.iup.edu/rahkonen/index.htm">Dr. Carl Rahkonen</a>, IUP music librarian and professor of music,&nbsp;known throughout the region for his talent on the violin, will&nbsp;be the guest artist&nbsp;on March 18, in conjunction with the showing of the Irish movie&nbsp;<em>Kisses</em>. </p>

<p>The showing of the Italian movie<em> Mid-August Lunch on </em>April 15 will feature Faisal Jousari, a student from Saudi Arabia, who will sing and play the lute.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The series ends on a <em>Terribly Happy </em>note on April 29, featuring student John Grant along with the screening of this Danish noir flick. Grant is&nbsp;a 30-year performer&nbsp;who sings and plays banjo and guitar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a great&nbsp;two for one evening. Bring the popcorn.</p>]]>

That location is IUP. </p>
<p>Thanks to the work of&nbsp;English professor&nbsp;Jim Cahalan and sociology professor Jim Dougherty, and the strong reputation of IUP's <a href="http://www.iup.edu/appalachianstudies/">Center for Northern Appalachian Studies</a>, the university will host more than 500 people for the ASA's <a href="http://www.appalachianstudies.org/conference/">35th annual conference</a>, "The Wide Reach of Appalachia,"&nbsp;on March 23-25.</p>
<p>All are recognized experts on various topics associated with Appalachia and will be making presentations and participating in panel discussions. </p>
<p>Some 50 IUP faculty, staff, graduate students, and retired faculty&nbsp;will&nbsp;showcase their expertise as presenters.</p>
<p>While most presentations are open only to conference registrants,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;four presentations free and open to the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Pennsylvania as Greater Appalachia: Historical Perspectives"&nbsp; </li>
<li>"Appalachian Impacts of Global Warming: Reasons for Hope" </li>
<li>"The&nbsp;Significance of Powwows to Native Americans in Pennsylvania's Appalachia"</li>
<li>"Uncovering Racist Sundown Towns in Appalachia and Beyond"</li></ul>

Tickets are $15 for adults and $8 for students, and will be on sale starting February 20 at the Hadley Union Building or at the door immediately before the concert. </p>
<p>Kahn has worked for more than 45 years as a musician and civic rights, labor, and community organizer. He was named the 2010 top folk artist by the Folk Alliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AND, to set the mood,&nbsp;Dougherty will be the presenter for the Six O'Clock Series program this Monday, February 20. His presentation, <a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=122256">"You Are Living in Appalachia,"</a>&nbsp;offers a "myth busters" perspective on Appalachia.</p>
<p>"People don't realize that being in Indiana, Pa., you're smack dab in the northern tier of Appalachia. Our goal is to raise awareness about this region and its connection to larger society," Dougherty says.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; float: right;" class="mt-image-right" alt="ScholarshipFundingStudentDebt.jpg" src="http://blog.iup.edu/aroundtheoakgrove/ScholarshipFundingStudentDebt.jpg" height="186" width="280" />As a contributor to<em> <a href="http://www.iup.edu/magazine">IUP Magazine</a></em>, the publication we send to more than 100,000 alumni and friends, I wrote a story for the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/magazine/feature.aspx?id=111617">summer edition</a> about student loan debt. I was surprised to learn while conducting the research for it that the average loan debt of an IUP&nbsp;graduate exceeds that of a private college or university graduate. </p>
<p>"How could that be?" I wondered, knowing that IUP is a state-owned school, and its cost is considerably lower. </p>
<p>In the magazine story, Patti McCarthy, IUP's director of <a href="http://www.iup.edu/financialaid">Financial Aid</a>, summed it up fairly and squarely: Unlike private schools, "We don't have a pot of money to automatically award scholarships upon admission to students who have a certain grade point average and SAT score." In other words, we don't have a centralized stash of private funding to defray our tuition costs.<br /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=123970&amp;blogid=5291">As of February 2012, that has changed. IUP has established the Academic Achievement Scholarship Fund</a>.&nbsp;The fund is meant to give our undergraduate admissions staff&nbsp;the ability&nbsp;to recruit the&nbsp;most qualified students with $1,000 and $2,000 awards and keep them here with renewable&nbsp;funding that is dependent on academic performance. By seeking gifts for this effort, IUP also is taking a crack at defraying student loan debt, a problem that concerns young graduates across the country.</p>
<p>Each year, a chunk of my paycheck goes toward two or three IUP causes. Last year, I gave to the John A. Pidgeon Scholarship (my father established this fund to benefit IUP's swimming team) and&nbsp;the Allegheny Arboretum (to help with the upkeep of the trees in the Oak Grove I purchased&nbsp;in memory of my mother). This year, I plan to direct some of&nbsp;my payroll deduction to the&nbsp;new <a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=123863">Academic Achievement Scholarship</a>.</p>
<p>I hope when you are asked to <a href="http://www.iup.edu/supportiup/default.aspx">give to IUP</a>--either through a mailing from our Annual Giving Office or through the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/supportiup/universityfamily/default.aspx">University Family Campaign</a>--you'll consider what your gift can mean. It could help IUP recruit qualified students through the Academic Achievement Scholarship Fund, or you could direct your gift in numerous other ways that enhance the experience we offer our students. </p>

The best part is that much of what you see is orchestrated by students--the newly formed pep band, the cheerleaders, two dance troupes, the Crimson Crazies (the rambunctious group that sits in the front rows of the student section)--and it all adds up to a fun event. Even the activities organized by the Kovalchick staff involve students hired to operate the facility--things like Kissin' Cam (yes,that moment when you and your date might be encouraged to kiss on camera for a prize) and three-point shot competition. <br /><br />So, on the eve of March Madness, when it's really the best time to watch basketball, head to Kovalchick Saturday night. The women's game starts at 5:30, and the men's game at 7:30.On February 11 we play Mercyhurst; February 18, Slippery Rock, and February 25, Gannon.&nbsp; Students are admitted free with an I-Card, and other ticket prices vary, depending on seating. <br /><br />Visit <a href="http://www.iupathletics.com/">www.iupathletics.com</a> for scores, stats, standings, and more. <br />]]>

<p>Thomas&nbsp;is the new president of <a href="http://www.wiu.edu/">Western Illinois University</a> and is six months into his term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span class="Apple-style-span">My first year is going quite well in light of a very challenging economy," he told us.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">His biggest obstacles, he noted, are those faced by presidents of many public universities:&nbsp;a decreased budget, declining state support, and deferred maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Thomas became president of WIU after serving as the university's provost, a position he took in 2008. <span class="Apple-style-span">Before joining WIU,</span>&nbsp;Thomas served as senior vice provost for academic affairs and interim dean at Middle Tennessee State University.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">His IUP degree is a <a href="http://www.iup.edu/english">Ph.D. in Literature and Criticism</a>.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Thomas offered the following advice to the IUP community as Driscoll's arrival draws near:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">"Approach his tenure with an open mind and give him all the support necessary for him to be successful as a university president. Give him an opportunity, and help him to learn the culture of IUP. Let him know that you are genuinely available to assist him.&nbsp;</span>The community should champion transparency and openness on all issues that concern the new president."<br /><br /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">Photo: Western Illinois University, Dr. Jack Thomas at his investiture as the university's 11th president.</font><br /></p>]]>

<p>Vaccaro, a visting faculty member in <a href="http://www.iup.edu/sociology/default.aspx">IUP's Department of Sociology</a>, conducted a two-year ethnographic study of mixed martial arts fighters to further understanding of&nbsp;how men manage their fears. The study was published in the December 2011 issue of <a href="http://spq.sagepub.com/">Social Psychology Quarterly</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>PPG </em>profile, <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/12030/1206624-114-0.stm?cmpid=news.xml#ixzz1l32QQU12">"Study of martial arts fighters attempts to shed light on how men manage their fears," </a>&nbsp;quoted Vaccaro as saying that most fighters never fully overcome their fear of losing or getting injured. However, they learn to manage it through "a number of mental strategies to exude dominance and maintain their masculine identity."</p>
<p>Vaccaro's research included interviews with more than 100 persons. He calls the process used by men "managing emotional manhood." His article also suggests that this ability may "create an emotional orientation that primes men to subordinate and harm others."</p>
<p>Vaccaro describes&nbsp;himself&nbsp;as a&nbsp;sociological social psychologist and symbolic interactionist interested in the study of&nbsp;gender, emotions, identity, and enbodiment. </p>
<p>The <em>PPG</em> article follows a <a href="http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=121298&amp;blogid=2603">number of mentions in national media</a>, including in&nbsp;the Huffington Post and <em>Men's Health News</em>.</p>]]>

<p>In January, Renda Broadcasting expanded its community programming with <a href="http://www.1160wccs.com/hometownmagazine.aspx">Hometown Magazine</a>, a show hosted by one of IUP's journalism graduates, Nick Ruffner&nbsp;'06. This news-talk show on WCCS (AM 1160), which&nbsp;airs conversations with two guests each weekday&nbsp;at 8:00&nbsp;and 9:00&nbsp;a.m., has&nbsp;made IUP feel right at home. </p>
<p>Be sure to catch the 8:00 a.m. show this Monday, February 6:&nbsp;Professor Dennis Giever from the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/criminology/default.aspx">Department of Criminology</a>&nbsp;will discuss the November 11 White House&nbsp;shooting event and the related arrest, made here in Indiana. </p>
<p>Since it launched,&nbsp;<em>Hometown Magazine </em>has also hosted&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=36267">Dr. David Chambers</a>, professor of<a href="http://www.iup.edu/politicalscience/default.aspx"> political science</a>,&nbsp;talking about the presidential primary, and Bill Spiedel, associate vice president for development in the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/universityrelations/default.aspx">University Relations Division.&nbsp;</a>Spiedel discussed how private giving makes a difference in the life of the university.</p>
<p>Mike Lemasters, executive director of housing, residential living, and dining and associate dean of campus living and learning, appeared on the program to give an update on IUP's new <a href="http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=121106&amp;blogid=6121">campus dining master plan</a>.</p>
<p>IUP's&nbsp;media relations director (yours truly) has been on the show twice to talk about&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=122208&amp;blogid=6121">selection of IUP's &nbsp;new president,</a>&nbsp;Michael Driscoll, and about a variety of campus programs and events, including the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=122244">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. program </a>and the <a href="http://www.iup.edu/sixoclockseries/">Six O'Clock Series</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, Nick, and congratulations on your new show.</p>
<p>For several years, IUP has also&nbsp;been a significant presence on two other&nbsp;Renda Broadcasting shows. <em>Indiana in the Morning,&nbsp;</em>on WDAD (AM 1450), was developed by Bill Otto and is hosted by&nbsp;Todd Marino,&nbsp;airing weekdays at 7:45 and 8:30 a.m. On the first Tuesday of every month, I share the latest IUP news. </p>
<p>We've also been featured many times on <em>A Closer Look, </em>which airs weekends at 7:20 a.m., 8:20 a.m., and&nbsp;12:20 p.m.&nbsp;Hosted by Ashley Pribicko, the show is broadcast on WCCS (AM 1160).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>IUP Daily</em> lists upcoming IUP guests for these shows. What a great resource for the Indiana community.&nbsp;Hope you tune in.&nbsp;</p>]]>

It's a question on everyone's mind on February 2.</p>
<p>We're talking, of course, about Punxsutawney Phil, the world's most famous groundhog, and whether he'll see his shadow at dawn on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney. </p>
<p>With all the&nbsp;fun around&nbsp;Groundhog Day, Phil has put Punxsutawney on the map.</p>
<p>But, there's a lot more to Punxsutawney than Phil.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iup.edu/punxsutawney/">IUP Punxsutawney</a>, a&nbsp;residential first-year campus with 350 students,&nbsp;will celebrate its 50th birthday this summer. The new $19 million<a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=48775"> Living-Learning Center</a> houses the academic programs, dining facilities, book store, and fitness facility. </p>
<p>Punxsutawney also is home to<a href="http://www.iup.edu/culinary/"> IUP's Academy of Culinary of Arts</a>, where about 100 students learn all facets of the&nbsp;culinary arts, including a specialized baking and pastry program, from world-renowned chefs. Our grads go on to&nbsp;internships at five-star restaurants and resorts and&nbsp;are in demand from hospitality providers throughout the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=84669&amp;blogid=6121">The Fairman Centre</a>&nbsp;is also new, the result of&nbsp;a $1.9 million&nbsp;gift from the Fairman family of Jefferson County and more than $2.4 million in grants and contributions&nbsp;from federal, state, and local agencies. The center, located&nbsp;in the heart of downtown,&nbsp;has allowed for expansion of&nbsp; culinary classes; residential space for students; and on the first floor, upscale retail facilities. </p>
<p>The campus is committed to <a href="http://www.iup.edu/newsItem.aspx?id=119643&amp;blogid=3123">service to the Punxsutawney community</a>. Students and faculty regularly volunteer with Rotary International of Punxsutawney; Big Brothers and Sisters; and&nbsp; the Salvation Army and Marine Corps Toys for Tots program. The commitment is mutual:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Punxsutawney Area College Trust is a longtime supporter&nbsp;of IUP,&nbsp;with gifts from members,&nbsp;including the&nbsp;Fairman family and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iup.edu/magazine/feature.aspx?id=78939">Elaine Light</a>,&nbsp;which have been critical&nbsp;to the continued success and recent&nbsp;new growth of IUP Punxsutawney.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;don't get us wrong -- we love Groundhog Day. Each year, hundreds of IUP students come out for the festivities, which include students&nbsp;in the academy's Ice Carving Club showcasing their skills in the&nbsp;square. On Wednesday,&nbsp;the academy&nbsp;hosted the annual Groundhog Day Chili and Hot Wing Cook-Off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't make it to Punxsutawney on Thursday? Celebrate at home by making a batch of&nbsp;<u><font color="#0066cc"><a href="http://www.iup.edu/magazine/page.aspx?id=79789">groundhog cookies</a></font></u>&nbsp;-- a special recipe from Light and her husband, Sam,&nbsp;former president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club.&nbsp;Don't forget to use your groundhog cookie cutters,&nbsp; available&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.groundhogstuff.com/">Punxsutawney Phil's Official Souvenir Shop</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you see your shadow or not,&nbsp;come out and celebrate. You'll certainly&nbsp;see&nbsp;more to enjoy in this community&nbsp;than just its world-renowned weather forecaster.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p align="left"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 20px 20px; float: right;" class="mt-image-right" alt="Thumbnail image for kopchick_lab.widea.jpg" src="http://blog.iup.edu/aroundtheoakgrove/assets_c/2012/01/kopchick_lab.widea-thumb-250x374-2939.jpg" height="374" width="250" />John Kopchick '72, M'75 recently learned that Ohio University's Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine's newest endowed research chair would be named for him. </p>
<p>Kopchick, the Goll Eminent Scholar and Professor in Molecular and Cellular Biology at OU,&nbsp;is widely admired as an inventor of Somavert, a drug that treats acromegaly. Somavert&nbsp;has saved the lives&nbsp;of millions of people with this&nbsp;disorder, which&nbsp;can cause excessive growth of organs and bones and lead to premature death. It has also brought millions of dollars to Ohio University.</p>
<p>The new chair was established in recognition of&nbsp;Kopchick's extraordinary contributions to the medical field and the university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This position is such an honor," he said.&nbsp;"The John J. Kopchick, Ph.D., Osteopathic Heritage Foundations Endowed Eminent Reseach Chair -- those words are very special. Thank you."</p>
<p>His stature notwithstanding, Kopchick's colleagues and students refer to him fondly as a down-to-earth friend&nbsp;and mentor who has a knack for building research teams, makes research fun,&nbsp;and is an inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Kopchick Chair is funded by a $5 million endowment supported by the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation and Ohio University.&nbsp;It will be held first&nbsp;by a researcher recruited into the college's Department of Biomedical&nbsp;Sciences&nbsp;in 2016.</p>
<p>"I&nbsp;would hope whoever is the recipient would do their research with the same philosophy that I had, which is to do something that's going to change the world," Kopchick said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recipient of <a href="http://www.iup.edu/upper.aspx?id=49011">IUP's Distinguished Alumni Award</a> several years ago, <a href="http://www.iup.edu/magazine/alumniextra/page.aspx?id=74395&amp;blogid=12117">Kopchick returned to campus in 2008</a> to receive an honorary doctoral degree and give the Commencement address.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 20px 20px; FLOAT: right" class="mt-image-right" alt="Six O'Clock Series" src="http://blog.iup.edu/aroundtheoakgrove/sixoclock.jpg" width="250" height="125" />Buildings rise and fall, people come and go, but IUP's <a href="http://www.iup.edu/sixoclockseries/">Six O'Clock Series</a> goes on.</p>
<p>Even after 36 years, this icon of ideas continues to bring interesting and thought-provoking programs to the community.</p>
<p>Every semester, students have come to expect a presentation that is sometimes academic, sometimes purely entertaining, but always interesting and relevant, on Monday evenings at 6:00--at the Hadley Union Building Ohio Room in recent years.</p>
<p>According to our Student Affairs area, it's almost unprecedented to have a program continue for three decades and still be successful. </p>
<p>So, what's the key?</p>
<p>"For one thing, faculty truly believe in the programs and encourage students to attend," Rick Kutz, <a href="http://www.iup.edu/studentlifecenter/default.aspx">Center for Student Life</a> staff member and current series coordinator, said. "We also try to respond to current events and mix outside experts with IUP presenters. The quality of the presenters are a&nbsp;draw for students and members of the community.</p>
<p>"It's a part of the institutional memory and culture here. We probably have students here whose parents remember going to the Six O'Clock Series programs."</p>
<p>Intriguing. So, we decided to go right to the source, Sherry Kuckuck, a 33-year member of the Student Affairs Division (now retired).</p>
<p>"I got the idea for the program at a conference in 1975," Dr. Kuckuck said. "I told Ron Thomas, then dean of men, 'Well, let's try it and see how it goes.' So, we started the program in February 1976."</p>
<p>Obviously, it went well. She directed the program for all but two of her years at IUP, and it was clearly a labor of love.</p>
<p>So, how did Dr. Kuckuck set the stage for its success?</p>
<p>"We chose topics that were relevant and important, and I got the best faculty speakers possible. The faculty knew that the presentations were going to be of high quality, because of of the presenters, and they recommended it to students and supported it. I never had a faculty member tell me no when I asked them to present.</p>
<p>"I also constantly invited people to submit program ideas. We'd get our suggested topics, put them on index cards, and match the topic cards to dates on the bulletin board with Scotch tape.</p>
<p>"My philosophy, in directing the program, was that we were responsible not only for helping students to learn to make a living, but to learn to make a life," she said.</p>

He shared several of the older posters with us.</p>
<p>"The first program for which we have documentation is from February 7, 1977, when Dr. John Merryman presented a values clarification workshop," Wick said. He also noted&nbsp;a program titled "<em>All in the Family:</em> People and Alcohol," presented by <a href="http://www.iup.edu/page.aspx?id=30235">Robert Witchel</a>, professor of counseling.</p>
<p>This semester, the series begins Monday, January 30, with Burrell Brown, a professor of management and labor management at California University of Pennsylvania, for the Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Program and Black History Month Kickoff. </p>
<p>His program&nbsp;will be followed each Monday by 10 presentations by a number of IUP faculty and staff members and external speakers:</p>
<ul>
<li>"A Woman's History&nbsp;of IUP," Theresa McDevitt, IUP Libraries</li>
<li>"Navajo Nation," Melanie Hildebrandt, Sociology,&nbsp;and students</li>
<li>"You Are Living in Appalachia," Jim Dougherty, Sociology</li>
<li>"Financial Literacy," Patricia McCarthy, Financial Aid</li>
<li>"College Scams and Identity Theft," Eric Rayko, PNC Bank</li>
<li>"Punished: Policing the Lives of Black and Latino Boys," Victor Rios</li>
<li>"Bullying: Making a Difference for All," Kelly Champion, Peaceful Families</li>
<li>"Autism: A Multidisciplinary Perspective," College of Education faculty</li>
<li>"Healing in Native American Culture," Pat Star Dancer Selinger, Thunder Mountain Lenapé Nation</li>
<li>"Accidential Icon: The Real Gidget Story," Kathy Zuckerman</li></ul>
<p>All of the programs are free and open to the community. If you've not taken the time to come over for a Six O'Clock Series program, clear some time on a Monday evening.</p>
<p>It's an IUP tradition. Be part of it.</p>]]>
