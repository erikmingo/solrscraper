“I am thrilled to have this strong group of freshmen joining us," said Cook. "They are an athletic class who has succeeded on the court and in the classroom and bring a high level of volleyball to an already solid group of returners. 

"I know each of them have high expectations for what they want to accomplish during their time here at Westmont," continued Cook. "They are both highly competitive and personable so I anticipate that they will hit the ground running when they join us in the fall.”]]></summary>

"We are delighted to add Kolby to our incoming class," said Westmont head coach Dave Wolf. "Kolby has worked very hard in all areas of his life to have arrived at this place. He’s a dangerous attacking player, and someone who will torment GSAC defenders. We have known Kolby for almost two years, and we are confident that he will take every advantage of the opportunity to come to Westmont."

As a member of the Strikers FC Whittier, McInally travelled to Argentina to participate in the 2014 Buenos Aires International Soccer Tournament (BA Cup). The team finished third in the club team tournament.]]></summary>

Her indoor season included a fifth-place finish in the pentathlon and a seventh-place finish in the high jump. In all, Collier earned four NAIA All-American awards and set two school records during her freshman campaign.]]></summary>

For some people, being involved with USA Basketball creates an opportunity to travel the world and broaden horizons. For John Moore, the order was reversed.

In Moore's case, spending his childhood years in another part of the world created an opportunity to become involved with USA Basketball and cement a love of the game that would shape his life forever.

Moore, the longtime and very successful head men's basketball coach at Westmont College in Santa Barbara California, was in Colorado Springs, Colorado, earlier this week to serve as a court coach for the 2014 USA Basketball Men's U18 National Team training camp. This was Moore's second stint as a USA Basketball court coach (he worked previously with the 2002 USA Men's U18 National Team). He's been a college coach for more than 30 years, following his playing days at Westmont. And it all started when he was a kid growing up in Japan – and his family played host to the U.S. Olympic Men's Basketball Team at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo.]]></summary>

The Warriors averaged 6.83 points, edging out Concordia by 0.02 points in the final standings.

"The GSAC all-sports award is especially pleasing because it is our second in a row and for me establishes that we are a well-rounded and consistently solid athletic program," said Westmont athletic director Dave Odell. "Our aim is to field competitive teams in every sport we’ve chosen to compete and this award demonstrates that we are doing this.

"I am especially pleased that with success on the field, we were also able to achieve strong results in the classroom," noted Odell. "The fall semester GPA average for student-athletes was higher than any previous semester.  Achieving within the academic rigors of Westmont, while being a full-time athlete, is quite a growing experience. I am quite proud of the way our student-athletes approach their business on and off the field."]]></summary>

Gildea was selected in the 36th round.

"I am extremely proud of Brandon for this tremendous accomplishment," said Westmont head coach Robert Ruiz. "He has been a four year contributor in our program and has improved each year. His humility, work ethic and leadership should provide a great foundation for the next steps in his baseball career. 

"Brandon was fortunate enough to draw attention from several MLB teams in this process. We are very thankful that the Angels organization took the time to follow Brandon's development and give him an opportunity in their organization. I am confident that he will represent himself and Westmont College very well in this new phase of his career."

Gildea, a two-time All-Golden State Athletic Conference selection, posted a .387 batting average in his senior year and a .524 slugging percentage. He tallied five home runs, two triples and 12 doubles among his 87 hits - a program record. He also drove in 38 RBIs.]]></summary>
