By folding the scaffold correctly, they could construct a three-dimensional block of tissue with the blood vessels and other structures running through it, she says—much like some origami designs neatly fold into a 3D object, such as a bird or flower.

But manned diving expeditions are expensive and limited in the amount of ocean area they can cover. To overcome those constraints, Patterson has developed a line of autonomous, underwater robots known as Fetches. 

Equipped with GPS, cameras, and various types of sensors, Fetch bots can collect vast amounts of data over time about water movement and the ocean floor, marine life populations, the condition of coral reefs, and oxygen levels.  

“The robot is thinking for itself, executing its mission, dealing with unforeseen circumstances, trying to preserve itself, and reacting to things it sees in the coastal zone,” says Patterson.

By deploying a small army of Fetch bots, scientists gain a more accurate picture of how and where the ocean is changing, and the impact of oceanic change on our climate and coastlines.

Spotting those trends requires the analysis of huge amounts of climate and engineering data, according to Ganguly.

Parker is shaping the field of personal health informatics—the use of technology to influence and inform the choices people make about their health.

She begins by examining disparities—such as limited access to nutritious food—that affect people with limited economic resources and elevate their risk for chronic health conditions. Then she applies her own interactive solutions to help people overcome those disparities.

For example, Parker is collaborating with colleagues at Northeastern to create digital programs—a mix of mobile applications, web-based games, and social media—to encourage low-income families to increase their weekly exercise and teenagers to become peer advocates for good nutrition.

And now he’s close to seeing his vision become reality.

Medications to manage schizophrenia have existed since the 1950s. But their side effects—sedation, neurological disorders, and extreme weight gain—mean patients often don’t stick to treatment plans. And current drugs aren’t nuanced enough to correct the imbalanced brain neurotransmission that underlies psychiatric disorders.

But Booth’s drug, Bromopatin, acts in a novel way to rebalance neurotransmission of the brain neurochemical serotonin. Bromopatin turns down activity of some serotonin receptors while turning up activity for others. Preclinical testing suggests no serious side effects.

Booth is working with pharmaceutical development partners toward clinical trials. If all goes well, Bromopatin could be available in a few years, bringing hope to the millions of people coping with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.]]></summary>

His studies on people’s exposure to indoor contaminants, such as the flame-retardant chemicals used in household furniture, electronics, and building materials, are a catalyst for environmental policy change—both locally and globally.

Always attuned to the world’s emerging environmental health issues, Brown has examined high-profile cases of contested illnesses, including one that resulted in numerous deaths from leukemia among children in Woburn, Mass.

His research group on environmental health science has been supported by numerous grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Environmental Protection Agency.

He is currently the director of the Social Science and Environmental Health Research Institute, an interdisciplinary center for research, teaching, community engagement, and policy work.]]></summary>
